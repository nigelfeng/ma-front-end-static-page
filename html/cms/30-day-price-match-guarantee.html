                We want you to shop with confidence at Music &amp; Arts so we
                have a guaranteed lowest price (GLP) and price match policy.
                Find a better deal? If you find the identical item advertised
                and in-stock at any authorized dealer, in-store or online, at a
                lower price, Music &amp; Arts will match it. For purposes of
                this offer, an “authorized local dealer” includes retailers
                whose business is the sale of first quality musical instruments,
                equipment and accessories which are authorized by substantially
                all of the manufacturers whose items they sell, including the
                item at issue. Our commitment covers pricing on items advertised
                by Guitar Center and those sold and shipped directly by
                Amazon.com, too.

                The first Music &amp; Arts was located in a small house in
                Bethesda, MD and run by founder Benjamin O’Brien. When Music
                &amp; Arts opened its doors in 1952, we offered printed music,
                music lessons, dance lessons, and art supplies. Ben decided
                shortly after opening his business that he wanted to focus on
                music to better serve his customers – a decision that remains
                intact to this day.
              </p>
              <p>
                Since the 1990’s, Music &amp; Arts has expanded nationwide
                through organic growth and a series of acquisitions and mergers
                with other music dealers. In 2005, Music &amp; Arts joined
                forces with American Music to become the largest band and
                orchestra instrument retailer in the United States.
              </p>
              <p>
                Music &amp; Arts now comprises 200+ retail stores, 120+
                educational representatives, and 300+ affiliate locations. Based

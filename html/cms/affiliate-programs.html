                Music &amp; Arts is a turnkey solution to competing in the
                rental market. While there are many companies that offer this
                service, none are as stable as Music &amp; Arts and that is a
                main reason my company has chosen to partner with Music &amp;
                Arts since 1989. Their instruments are high quality and if there
                ever is a problem with any aspect of renting, it is addressed
                efficiently. They are excellent with communication and let's
                face it, in today's market place communication services add to
                the bottom line.

                When I opened my business 20 years ago, I was strictly a
                teaching studio and I've been an affiliate store of Music &amp;
                Arts for the last 13 years. I buy most of my books from them and
                some of my instrument supplies.<br />By becoming an affiliate
                store of Music &amp; Arts we are able to be a "One stop shop"
                music store. Without their affiliation we would have to send
                customers to other places to buy their lesson books, supplies
                and instrument rentals. Our customers always tell us how much
                they appreciate being able to get everything they need from us.
                I would recommend that any new business owner or a business
                owner that was thinking of expanding their business consider
                becoming an affiliate of Music &amp; Arts.

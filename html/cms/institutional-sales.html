              <p>
                Kienan worked for two years on the retail side of Music &amp;
                Arts before moving into the main office two years ago. The
                impact of music in his own early education steered him to a path
                in the industry. Accomplished on the piano, saxophone, and steel
                drum, Kienan studied music education at Frostburg State
                University in Maryland, where he met his wife, Jessie, also a
                Music &amp; Arts employee. His musical tastes run from classic
                rock to rap/R&amp;B to some Caribbean genres. Beyond music,
                Kienan enjoys technology, particularly video games, and hosts a
                gaming podcast.

                Trey was a Texas All-State trombonist in 1991 and marched in the
                inaugural parade for President George H.W. Bush with the Midland
                Lee High School band. He studied music at the University of
                Texas at Austin, as well as creative writing at Texas Tech
                University in Lubbock. Trey went to work for Brook Mays Music in
                Dallas in 1999 and came to Music &amp; Arts when the company
                expanded to Dallas in 2006. Trey is an avid collector of music
                and books, particularly performances by the late pianist
                Sviatoslav Richter. He chose to work in the music industry
                because he wanted to give all students a chance to play an
                instrument, regardless of financial limitations. Trey is working
                on his first collection of short stories, and also loves
                spending time with his wife and son.

              <p>
                Judy—the daughter of two musicians—first began working in a
                music store part time while pursuing her psychology degree at
                Wichita State University in Kansas, and discovered a love of
                working with educators and students. She has worked for Wichita
                Band Instrument, California Musical Instrument in Anaheim,
                Washington Music Center in Wheaton, Maryland, and finally Music
                &amp; Arts in Frederick, Maryland. Her own instruments of choice
                are the piano and tap shoes, and she loves jazz and big band
                music. A passionate advocate for music education, Judy has
                participated in the National Association of Music Merchants
                Music Education Fly-In for the past eight years, converging on
                Washington, D.C., to meet with senators, congressmen and their
                staffers and talk about the importance of music education in
                schools.

                Lou can remember crawling around on the floor in front of the
                sax section of his father’s big band. Now a saxophonist in his
                own right, playing with local big bands and jazz combos around
                Frederick, Maryland, Lou has spent 25 years in retail music
                sales—eight of those with Music &amp; Arts. He previously worked
                for the National Education Music Company in New Jersey and
                Cascio Interstate Music. Lou also spent years as a full-time
                performer in show pit bands, dinner theatre and night club bands
                around Manhattan, New Jersey, Atlantic City and Philadelphia.
                Lou is particularly excited to have Music &amp; Arts collaborate
                with programs like Mr. Holland’s Opus Foundation, which help
                supply instruments to schools in need. In his free time, Lou
                loves any outdoor activities—from gardening to golf to jazz
                jams.

                Tom is a percussionist who graduated from Texas A&amp;M
                University–Commerce with a degree in business administration and
                a minor in music. He started working at a music store part time
                in college, and hasn’t looked back. With 28 years of full-time
                music retail sales and management experience, he joined Music
                &amp; Arts in 2006 as an educational buyer.
                <!--He volunteered with the Duncanville High School Band Boosters, outside of Dallas, as well as for the Boy Scouts of America.-->
                Music is a family affair for Tom: His wife Caressa is a clarinet
                instructor, and his sons, a percussionist and a saxophonist, are
                both pursuing musical studies at the college level.

                electronically in a portable and, to the extent technically
                feasible, readily useable format that allows the individual to
                transmit this information to another entity without hindrance.

                provide them certain information about how we have handled their
                personal information in the prior 12 months, including the:

                <strong><em>Right to Non-discrimination.</em></strong> The CCPA
                prohibits discrimination against California residents for
                exercising their rights under the CCPA. Discrimination may exist
                where a business denies or provides a different level or quality
                of goods or services, or charges (or suggests that it will
                charge) different prices, rates, or penalties on residents who
                exercise their CCPA rights, unless doing so is reasonably
                related to the value provided to the business by the residents’
                data.

                <strong><em>Financial Incentives.</em></strong> A business may
                offer financial incentives for the collection, sale or deletion
                of California residents’ personal information, provided it is
                not unjust, unreasonable, coercive or usurious, and is made
                available in compliance with applicable transparency, informed
                consent, and opt-out requirements. California residents have the
                right to be notified of any financial incentives offers and
                their material terms, the right to opt-out of such incentives at
                any time, and may not be included in such incentives without
                their prior informed opt-in consent.

                There are several options when it comes to obtaining an
                instrument, and when you’re a beginner, the best bet is almost
                always to rent. That’s because renting gives you the opportunity
                to sample the cello without a long-term commitment, and it
                offers some unique perks and advantages that make the first
                steps of your musical journey a breeze. In this guide, you’ll
                learn the basics of what renting can do for you, as well as some
                tips for taking care of your <span>rental cello</span>.
              </p>
              <!--/Intro Paragraph-->
              <h2 class="umb-text--normal">The Benefits of Renting a Cello</h2>
              <p>
                Of all the great things about renting, the best is probably the
                freedom it allows. You can try your hand at the cello, and if it
                turns out not to be the instrument for you, then you’ll be able
                to return the cello or exchange it for another instrument,
                hassle-free. There’s also the fact that the first few months
                spent learning an instrument tend to be hard on it, and with a
                rented cello, you won’t have to subject an expensive purchased
                instrument to that wear-and-tear.
              </p>
              <h3 class="umb-text--normal">A Service Network</h3>
              <p>
                Most With many local stores and affiliates to choose from,
                you’ll always have someplace to go when it comes time for a
                tune-up or <a href="/MAC-Repairs-g20008t0.mac">repair</a>.
              </p>
              <h3 class="umb-text--normal">A Perfect Fit</h3>
              <p>
                For the cello, it’s very important that the instrument’s size be
                matched to the player. When renting, you have the opportunity to
                exchange for larger cellos as necessary, so a growing cellist
                can always have the right size instrument. Your child’s teacher
                will help size them appropriately before renting.
              </p>
              <h3 class="umb-text--normal">A Path to Ownership</h3>
              <p>
                In most states, your rental payments will accrue credit that can
                be used to buy out your cello or even purchase a more advanced
                model. This way, you can enjoy the benefits of renting and still
                end up owning the instrument that is best suited to the player.
              </p>
              <h3 class="umb-text--normal">Professional Preparation</h3>
              <p>
                Most rental cellos are in “like new” condition, meaning that
                they’re previously played and expertly serviced for top
                performance. This means you don’t have to worry about a break-in
                period.

              <h2 class="umb-text--normal">Care Tips for Your Cello</h2>
              <p>
                The next step after deciding to rent a cello is to read up on
                care and maintenance techniques so you can keep it in great
                shape after it arrives. Here are some basic pointers to get you
                started.
              </p>
              <h3 class="umb-text--normal">Before and After Playing:</h3>
              <ul class="arrow">
                <li>
                  An uneven bridge will affect the cello's tone, so check that
                  the bridge is straight. If it needs adjustment, gently pinch
                  it between your thumbs and index fingers to straighten it with
                  care. Ask your instructor for help if you have trouble.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Apply rosin to the bow before playing, and wipe down the
                  strings afterward with a soft cloth to remove any build-up
                  left behind.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3 class="umb-text--normal">Storage Tips:</h3>
              <ul class="arrow">
                <li>
                  Always keep the cello in its case when not in use, and turn it
                  so the front faces the wall while it's stored. This will help
                  prevent the bridge from being moved if somebody bumps into it.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Extreme heat, cold, dryness or humidity can all cause damage
                  to the cello's wood, so store the instrument at room
                  temperature and where the humidity is not too high or too low.
                </li>

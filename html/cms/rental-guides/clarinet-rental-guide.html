                  When a young musician first joins a band program, renting an
                  instrument is almost always the most economical option for
                  parents. Not only does a good rental program come with a
                  variety of benefits and perks, it also takes away the obstacle
                  of a big up-front payment, and renting can make it easy to own
                  the clarinet or even upgrade to a more advanced model when the
                  time is right. The clarinet is a great instrument for
                  beginning band students and we’re here to help you with
                  everything you need to rent a clarinet.

                  The Advantages of Renting a Clarinet
                </h2>
                <p>
                  While the best advice a beginning clarinetist can receive is
                  to stick with the program, that’s no guarantee the
                  <span>clarinet</span> will be right for everybody. Renting
                  allows you to try out band at a minimum of expense, and it
                  keeps open the option of changing instruments if something
                  else seems like a better fit. You’ll also appreciate a rented
                  clarinet for bearing the wear-and-tear that goes with learning
                  how to maintain and handle an instrument. As part of a good
                  rental program, you can expect to receive plenty of support
                  that will help you out should something go wrong with the
                  clarinet, or when the time comes to step up from beginner to
                  intermediate and even the professional level.

                  clarinet that provides an upgrade path to intermediate and

                  Keep Track of your Cleaning Supplies
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Clarinets require frequent cleaning to avoid the buildup of
                  saliva and bacteria in the instrument. Make sure you have the
                  following items to keep your instrument clean
                </p>
                <ul class="arrow">
                  <li>
                    Cork Grease – greasing the corks of your clarinet will
                    decrease your chance of damage while assembling the
                    instrument
                  </li>
                  <li>Silk Swab – to clean inside the instrument</li>
                  <li>
                    Mouthpiece Brush – since this is where your mouth contacts
                    the instrument, keeping it clean is vital
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Polish Cloth – removing excess fingerprints and smudges will
                    keep the instrument’s exterior clean
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <h3 class="umb-text--normal" role="heading" aria-level="2">
                  Immediately After Playing
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Always remove the reed, and store it in a
                  <a href="/Reed-Cases-Woodwind-Cases---Gig-Bags.mac"
                    >reed case</a
                  >. Give the clarinet a quick but thorough cleaning to remove
                  any saliva and warm air that’s built up inside, and wipe off
                  all the exterior surfaces. Be sure to remove the mouthpiece
                  and clean it individually, as well. Then, put the clarinet
                  into its case to protect it. Whenever the clarinet is in its
                  case, the mouthpiece should be capped.
                </p>
                <h3 class="umb-text--normal" role="heading" aria-level="2">
                  On a Regular Basis
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Deeper cleanings should be done frequently; every few days for
                  a clarinet that is constantly played, or after every use
                  otherwise.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Take the clarinet apart to clean each component, and dry the
                  tenons while it’s disassembled. Your instrument should come
                  with a swab, designed to be passed cloth-first from barrel to
                  bell through the clarinet body. Pull the swab through several
                  times, until the inside of the clarinet is clean. You can also
                  use the swab to clean the insides of the clarinet’s joints.
                  Wait for the swab to dry before putting it back into the case.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Wipe down the ligature and keys to remove any lingering
                  fingerprints. Use a gentle polishing cloth – no need for metal
                  polish or any other abrasives. A handy tool for keys and
                  especially tone holes is a dusting stick, which is a long wire
                  with a miniature broom on one end and a pick on the other. You
                  can use the pick end to clear away dirt from beneath and
                  between keys, and the broom end to brush off any dust.

                <p>
                  Apply oil to the key mechanisms to keep them moving freely.
                  Remember that a little goes a long way, and always clean up
                  any stray drips.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Using your fingers, rub a modest amount of cork grease onto
                  the corks. It’s important not to do this too often as that can
                  weaken the corks, so check their dryness and wear, and apply
                  when necessary.

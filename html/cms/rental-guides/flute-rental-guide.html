                For most students, a rented instrument is the way to go when
                starting out in band. Renting is more affordable than
                purchasing, and it comes with some perks that can make a big
                difference in the learning process for a new flutist. The
                following guide contains all the information you need to rent a
                <span>flute</span>.

              <h2 class="umb-text--normal">Why Rent a Flute?</h2>
              <p>
                Perseverance is the first ingredient in a successful band
                experience, but there is always the chance that something will
                crop up. Maybe a child will decide to go for sports over band,
                or perhaps to switch to a different instrument. Renting makes it
                easier to return the flute in cases like these. If you rent a
                flute, there is time to gain experience and decide whether to
                stick with the flute. For those who do, a rental package
                provides the flexibility to step up to a more advanced
                instrument later.

                What to Look For in a Flute Rental Program
              </h2>
              <p>
                The following are some of the most important features of a good
                rental program. It's important to make sure you have options to
                return, exchange, repair, purchase or upgrade at any time. This
                way the rental contract itself does not impact the growth of the
                student, and will foster a better learning environment. Lets
                take a look at these items in depth:
              </p>
              <h3 class="umb-text--normal">Maintenance &amp; Repair</h3>
              <p>
                When your flute needs a simple tune-up or an issue appears that
                requires fixing, you'll have easy access to those
                <a href="/MAC-Repairs-g20008t0.mac">repair services</a> through
                a network of stores and local affiliates. Flute repairs can be
                costly, so make sure you're covered against incidental damage to
                avoid breaking the bank.
              </p>
              <h3 class="umb-text--normal">Rental Exchanges at no Charge</h3>
              <p>
                Rental exchanges allow the player to change instruments at any
                time and free of charge. This is important because kids change
                their minds frequently, and being able to exchange the
                instrument will keep them interested in music longer, which is
                the main goal.
              </p>
              <h3 class="umb-text--normal">Easy Buyout or Upgrade</h3>
              <p>
                As you rent a flute, you can earn credit toward purchasing a
                student flute or stepping up to an
                <a href="/Intermediate-Flutes-Flutes.mac">intermediate flute</a>
                if the student continues to play.
              </p>
              <h3 class="umb-text--normal">Reliable Quality</h3>
              <p>
                Most rental flutes are in "like new" condition. You may be
                surprised to learn that this is actually an advantage over a
                brand-new flute. Following its previous rental, the flute will
                have been completely adjusted by the shop in order to get it
                into prime playing condition. Plus, a brand new instrument can
                be stiff, and requires being "broken in" before it plays much
                easier. A lightly used instrument is ideal for a new player.
              </p>
              <h3 class="umb-text--normal">Replacement</h3>
              <p>
                An available Liability Damage Waiver (LDW) will give you peace
                of mind by providing repairs at no cost to you if the instrument
                needs to be adjusted. Additionally, you could receive a
                replacement flute in the event that the instrument is beyond
                repair.
              </p>
              <h2 class="umb-text--normal">Caring for your Flute</h2>
              <p>
                To get the most out of your rented flute, it's important to keep
                the instrument in good condition. Here are some helpful
                pointers.
              </p>
              <h3 class="umb-text--normal">Always Do:</h3>
              <ul class="arrow">
                <li>Handle the flute with clean, dry hands.</li>
                <li>
                  When assembling the flute, hold it by the edges and not by the
                  keys.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Clean the flute as soon as possible after it has been played.
                  This will help to keep the pads in good condition.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Disassemble the flute and return it to its case when not in
                  use.
                </li>
                <li>Store the flute at room temperature.</li>
              </ul>
              <h3 class="umb-text--normal">Always Avoid:</h3>
              <ul class="arrow">
                <li>
                  Using the same cloth to clean the inside and outside of the
                  flute. Instead, use a separate cloth for each.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Using metal polish on the flute. This can damage the finish.
                  Instead, polish it gently with a soft, dry cloth.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Lubricating the flute. This should not be necessary; if the
                  action isn't working smoothly, consider taking the flute for
                  service.
                </li>

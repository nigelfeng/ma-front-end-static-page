                There’s more to a drummer’s role than simply keeping time – in
                fact, school band percussionists may play any number of
                instruments, from triangles and tambourines to timpanis and
                xylophones. Typically, a percussion kit features a tunable drum
                practice pad or shallow drum, snare sticks and bell mallets, a
                2-octave aluminum bell set and a stand – all of which is stored
                in a luggage-style rolling bag. Of course, what a
                <span>student’s percussion kit</span> should consist of will
                depend on the needs of the band, and what the band director has
                planned for the curriculum. While buying a child’s first musical
                instrument can be a wonderful experience, there are more
                advantages to renting when it comes a percussion kit, and here
                are some reasons why.
              </p>

              <h2 class="umb-text--normal">Rentals are Easier to Exchange</h2>
              <p>
                Since the attention span of children can be very sporadic, it’s
                only natural that a younger player might want to try something
                else. Renting gives you the flexibility of exchanging an
                instrument for another one, and quite often at no extra cost.

                Measure Your Child’s Commitment
              </h3>
              <p>
                Do you think your child will continue playing percussion years
                from now? It’s hard to say – after all, younger minds can change
                at the drop of a beat! At least with a rental, you can see how
                much dedication they’re willing to put into practicing without
                worrying about being stuck with an instrument that will never be
                touched.

                Renting is easy and inexpensive – it’s as simple as that. Plus,
                if you decide that you’d like to buy your percussion kit, you
                can apply a portion of the rent cost to your final purchase of
                the instrument – or any other instrument a student might be
                interested in playing.

                Having a plan set up will ensure a student’s percussion kit is
                in top working order, and it will also have you covered in the
                event of the kit being lost or stolen.

                When you <em>buy</em> a percussion kit, you're only getting the
                instrument and it's up to the musician to kick start their own
                musical journey. With a rental from Music &amp; Arts, you'll
                receive more than just the instrument. In fact, you can even
                customize your rental so it pertains exactly to the age and
                skill level of the musician you have in mind. Other benefits to
                renting include:

              <p>
                Percussion equipment needs to be looked after in order for a
                student to get the most out of their playing experience. When
                the instruments are not being used, they should be put back in
                their cases. The padded bag provided with your rental kit will
                have a secure and safe spot for each and every instrument that
                came with it. Putting everything back after a performance will
                protect each instrument from dust and moisture, as well as
                safeguard them from any sudden impact with other objects.

                Whether you're a <span>beginning saxophonist</span> or mature
                musician who isn't sure they have the time to fully dedicate to
                the saxophone, it's a good idea to rent when starting out with a
                new instrument. Renting provides the perfect introduction to the
                saxophone, and it allows younger players (and their parents) the
                chance to really get a feel for their instrument before making
                the investment of buying. As with any important decision, it's
                best to research all your options before choosing the saxophone
                rental that is going to suit your (and your child's) musical
                needs. This guide outlines everything you need to know to rent a
                saxophone- with some quick tips on how to care for your
                instrument.

                Saxophone Rental 101 - What you need to know
              </h2>
              <p>
                The first step in the rental process should be determining which
                type of saxophone to play. There are 4 major types that offer
                many different sounds including soprano, alto, tenor and
                baritone. The alto and tenor are the most played types of
                saxophones, with the alto being the most popular choice for
                beginning musicians. Once you've made the decision as to which
                saxophone you or your child want to play, you should sit down
                and thoroughly research everything the rental plan you've
                selected has to offer. This information may seem overwhelming,
                but a good rental program should provide step-by-step
                instruction on how to rent, return, upgrade and maintain your
                instrument. Here are a few examples of what to look for in a
                rental plan.

                If there is not a brick and mortar store nearby, you should be
                able to contact the rental company directly for more specific
                repair instructions. Inquire about lost or stolen instruments as
                well: with the addition of a Liability Damage Waiver, you are
                generally covered in the case of a damaged or irreparable

              <p>
                Itâ€™s not unusual for a student to advance beyond the beginner
                level before the first rental term is up, so look to rent a
                saxophone that provides an upgrade path to intermediate and
                professional saxophones.

              </h3>
              <p>
                Many companies offer credit during your rental term that can be
                applied to the purchase of a future instrument. This is comes in
                handy if a student saxophonist is dedicated, talented and ready
                to upgrade to an intermediate or professional-level instrument.
                You may also have the option to buyout your rental at a reduced
                price when you rent a saxophone.

                Quick Care Tips For Your Saxophone
              </h2>
              <p>
                Help keep your sax in tip-top condition by following these care
                tips:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>1. Make sure you have all of your cleaning supplies</li>
                <ul class="arrow">
                  <li>Key Oil - to keep your key joints smooth</li>
                  <li>
                    Swab - to remove excess saliva and bacteria from inside the
                    instrument
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Cork Grease - grease prevents cracking in the tenon cork
                  </li>
                  <li>Mouthpiece Brush - removes the gunk in the mouthpiece</li>
                </ul>
                <li>
                  2. Clean your saxophone immediately after each playing or
                  practice session. Wipe down the outside and inside the bell
                  with a clean cloth. Be careful not to use cleaning products or
                  polish: these could get onto the pads, which can shorten their
                  lifespan considerably.
                </li>
                <li>
                  3. When you're not using your sax, store it in its case.
                  Properly housing your instrument will go a long way toward
                  keeping it in the best shape possible.
                </li>
                <li>
                  4. Handle your saxophone with care. Don't pick it up by its
                  neck. Instead, use both hands and grasp it firmly around the
                  body.

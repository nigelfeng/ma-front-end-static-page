            <div>
              <p>
                Not every beginner’s musical endeavor should begin with the
                purchase of a brand new instrument. In many cases – especially
                when it comes to brass and woodwinds – it makes more sense to go
                with a rental. The <span>trombone</span> is no exception, and
                today’s rental programs offer many perks and advantages.
              </p>
              <p>
                Let’s take a look at why a player should stick with a rental in
                their early stages of playing.
              </p>
              <!--/Intro Paragraph-->
              <h2 class="umb-text--normal">Rental Packages – The Lowdown</h2>
              <p>
                There are definitely a few things to consider in a trombone
                rental package:
              </p>
              <h3 class="umb-text--normal">
                Exchange the Instrument – At No Extra Cost!
              </h3>
              <p>
                It’s as simple as the title suggests. Renting instead of buying
                is a great way to see if your aspiring player wants to dedicate
                themselves to the instrument for many years to come. After all,
                children tend to change their minds at the drop of a hat – at
                least with a rental, you can exchange your trombone for
                something else that tickles their fancy.
              </p>
              <h3 class="umb-text--normal">Renting Can Save You Money</h3>
              <p>
                As opposed to buying one, you can rent a trombone for a very low
                monthly fee. You can even have the option of applying part of
                your rental fee to an actual trombone purchase.
              </p>
              <h3 class="umb-text--normal">
                Maintenance &amp; Replacement Plan
              </h3>
              <p>
                This one is crucial. Having a plan set up will not only ensure
                your trombone can be replaced in the event of it being stolen or
                damaged, but it also means that the trombone will receive proper
                maintenance from a professional so it continues operating at its
                best.
              </p>
              <h3 class="umb-text--normal">Upgrading Flexibility</h3>
              <p>
                It’s not uncommon for an entry-level player to progress on their
                instrument quickly – sometimes even before their rental term is
                up. Try to find a rental package that gives you the option of
                upgrading to an intermediate or professional horn when you think
                the time has come to do so.
              </p>

                Taking Care of Your Trombone Rental
              </h2>
              <p>
                Proper maintenance of your trombone is crucial to its
                playability and sound quality. Not to mention, the last thing
                you want to do is return a damaged trombone to a rental shop.
                Here’s a few helpful tips to keep your trombone looking and
                sounding its best.
              </p>
              <ul class="arrow">
                <li>Make sure the trombone’s valves are lubricated.</li>
                <li>
                  Never use hot water to wash the instrument or mouthpiece.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When your instrument isn’t being played, keep it stored in its
                  case.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Corks and felts should never be wet, but liquid soap is safe
                  (and recommended) to use.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Hold the trombone upright to prevent its hand slide from
                  making any sudden contact with stands.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Remove fingerprints from your trombone by using a soft cloth.
                </li>
                <li>Don’t forget your maintenance supplies!</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                We hope this guide helps you in your search for the perfect
                trombone rental.

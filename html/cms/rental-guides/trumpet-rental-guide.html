                Advantages to Renting your Trumpet
              </h2>
              <p>
                For most aspiring musicians, kickstarting their musical journey
                begins with the purchase of their first musical instrument. When
                it comes to trumpets, however, this is not typically the case –
                in fact, most young brass and woodwind players rent their first
                instrument. Going with a <span>trumpet rental</span> has many
                upsides over buying one, and within this section we’ll explain
                why.
              </p>
              <!--/Intro Paragraph-->
              <h3 class="umb-text--normal">
                A Child’s Mind Can Change – Fast!
              </h3>
              <p>
                It’s a simple fact that needs to be faced – we were all kids at
                one point, so you’re aware of how quickly a child’s interest in
                something can quickly dwindle. Basically, going with a rental is
                a simple way to test the waters, to see how much time your
                youngster is willing to commit to practicing their trumpet
                skills, and to determine if it’s something that they want to
                continue with even well into their teens. And if they do lose
                interest, you can always have the choice of switching your
                trumpet with another instrument – quite often at no extra cost.
              </p>
              <h3 class="umb-text--normal">Renting Costs Less</h3>
              <p>
                This one is an obvious no-brainer, but renting a trumpet as
                opposed to buying one definitely keep more money in your wallet.
                Typically, trumpets have one of the lowest rental rates for band
                instruments. In fact, when you're ready to buy a trumpet, some
                shops will even allow you to apply a portion of your rental to
                the final purchase.
              </p>
              <h3 class="umb-text--normal">Trumpets - More Than One Type</h3>
              <p>
                There's more than one type of trumpet. Here's a list of the most
                popular kinds:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Bb:</strong> The type most commonly found, Bb trumpets
                  are also what most entry-level players start with, since
                  you'll find a wide range of instructional material and music
                  written specifically for this trumpet type.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>C:</strong> Used often in orchestral settings, C
                  trumpets are shorter than B-flat trumpets and their pitch and
                  fingering also differ slightly.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>D:</strong> While they were more popular in the 19th
                  century, D trumpets are still used today, but a beginner
                  student should only go with this type if they expect to play
                  older, Baroque-style music.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                There are other types as well, but the Bb trumpet is the best
                one to go with if you're in the market for a younger player.
              </p>
              <h2 class="umb-text--normal">Rental Packages</h2>
              <p>
                Now that you have an idea of why renting is better than buying
                for a beginner, here's a few things to look for in the rental
                package itself.
              </p>
              <h3 class="umb-text--normal">
                Maintenance &amp; Replacement Plan
              </h3>
              <p>
                With this plan, your trumpet can continue to play its best, and
                you also have the option to replace it in the event of it
                getting damaged or stolen. Be sure to add the Liability and
                Damage Waiver to your next Music &amp; Arts rental for peace of
                mind.
              </p>
              <h3 class="umb-text--normal">Starter Packs</h3>
              <p>
                Most rental providers have a bundle of accessories you can
                purchase in addition to your rental that will save you time and
                money getting the supplies you need to be successful.
              </p>
              <h3 class="umb-text--normal">Return &amp; Exchange Options</h3>
              <p>
                The idea of a rental is to see if the instrument is right for
                you. For this reason, all Music &amp; Arts rental instruments
                can be returned or exchanged at any time.
              </p>
              <h3 class="umb-text--normal">Upgrade Options</h3>
              <p>
                It was mentioned earlier that some music shops, Music &amp; Arts
                included, will let you put a portion of your rental equity
                toward the purchase of a beginner, intermediate or professional
                level horn. Of course, there's nothing wrong with renting even
                after you're well-versed with the instrument, and some students
                advance quicker than others - sometimes even before their first
                rental term has expired. In this case, an ideal rental package
                would let you upgrade to a higher quality horn when you're
                ready.

                Taking Care of Your Trumpet Rental
              </h2>
              <p>
                Just because the trumpet isn't technically yours, that doesn't
                mean you shouldn't look after it. To avoid any additional
                charges - and to ensure you're getting the most out of your
                playing experience - here are some care tips:
              </p>
              <ul class="arrow">
                <li>Ensure the slides are well greased.</li>
                <li>
                  Apply a cloth to eliminate excess oil and grease. Not doing so
                  may cause the instrument's metal to corrode over time.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Oil the trumpet's valves so they continue to move smoothly
                  during a performance. This should be done 2-3 times weekly.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Keep the instrument in its case when you're not playing it.

                Learning to play a new instrument is an exciting but uncertain
                time. Will you enjoy the viola and stick with it, or will you
                decide it’s not for you and try a different instrument instead?
                The answer to this question is something you’ll only find out
                once you give it a shot, and that’s why
                <span>renting a viola</span> first is a good idea. You’ll get
                the chance to try it out without committing to a purchase, and
                you’ll enjoy some other benefits as well.
              </p>

              <h2 class="umb-text--normal">The Advantages of Renting</h2>
              <p>
                The freedom to return the viola or switch to another instrument
                is only the beginning of what renting has to offer. You’ll also
                have access to special provisions and service arrangements
                available for the duration of your rental term. And with a
                rented instrument to take the wear and tear of the learning
                process, you won’t have to worry about damage to your
                investment. That’s a general summary of what to expect, and it
                gets even better when you look at the details.

                Service and Maintenance Arrangements
              </h3>
              <p>
                When your viola needs a tune-up or a
                <a href="/MAC-Repairs-g20008t0.mac">repair</a>, simply bring it
                to a local store or affiliate shop to get the care it needs.
              </p>
              <h3 class="umb-text--normal">Rental Exchanges at no Charge</h3>
              <p>
                Rental exchanges allow the player to change instruments at any
                time and free of charge. This is important because kids change
                their minds frequently, and being able to exchange the
                instrument will keep them interested in music longer, which is
                the main goal.
              </p>
              <h3 class="umb-text--normal">An Instrument that Grows</h3>
              <p>
                Renting gives you the option to exchange the viola for a larger
                model, so it will always be the right fit for a young player
                growing up. If you’re renting for a student in school, your
                child’s educator will help decide when it’s time to move up a
                size.
              </p>
              <h3 class="umb-text--normal">The Option to Own</h3>
              <p>
                With each rental payment, you build credit toward the purchase
                of a student viola like the one you rented, or even an upgraded
                model when you’re ready.
              </p>
              <h3 class="umb-text--normal">Damage Coverage</h3>
              <p>
                With the addition of a Liability Damage Waiver (LDW) to your
                viola rental plan, you can rest easy knowing that you’re
                protected against damage or theft.

                Keeping Your Viola Rental in Shape
              </h2>
              <p>
                Once you’ve rented a viola, it’s important to take care of it to
                keep it in good playing condition. Here are the basic practices
                to help you on your way:
              </p>
              <h3 class="umb-text--normal">Before you Play:</h3>
              <ul class="arrow">
                <li>
                  Use the screw beneath the frog to tighten the bow hairs.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Apply rosin to the bow by rubbing the hairs gently back and
                  forth against the rosin.
                </li>
                <li>Ensure that the chin rest is adjusted properly.</li>
                <li>Don't forget your care kit!</li>
              </ul>
              <h3 class="umb-text--normal">After you Play:</h3>
              <ul class="arrow">
                <li>
                  Clean the viola strings with a soft cloth to remove built-up
                  rosin and other debris.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Let the tension out of the bow hairs to keep them from
                  becoming stretched or damaged between plays.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Place the viola carefully in its case after use, and store it
                  in a place that's room temperature and not too humid nor too
                  dry.
                </li>

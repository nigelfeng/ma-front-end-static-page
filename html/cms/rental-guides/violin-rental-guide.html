                For a newcomer to the world of <span>violin</span>, a rental
                instrument simply makes sense. Compared to buying, it’s much
                more affordable and also provides better support in the critical
                early learning stage. In this brief guide, you’ll learn what
                makes renting so practical, and what you can expect from your
                rental experience.

              <h2 class="umb-text--normal">The Perks of Renting a Violin</h2>
              <p>
                One of the biggest advantages to renting a violin is that
                there’s a lower degree of commitment. If you decide that the
                violin isn’t for you after all, or that you’d like to try a
                different instrument instead, you can simply return the rental,
                no questions asked. Renting is the perfect way to give the
                violin a trial run, and you will have the opportunity to buy out
                the instrument or even advance to a higher-end model when the
                time is right. And that’s only the beginning.

                Service Plans
              </h3>
              <p>
                With a network of stores and affiliates at the ready, it’s easy
                to find the expertise you need when it’s time for a tune-up or
                repair.

                A Violin That Grows With You
              </h3>
              <p>
                As a child grows, the rented violin can be exchanged at no added
                cost for an equivalent, larger-scale model.
              </p>

              </h3>
              <p>
                The rental payments you make will earn credit toward buying out
                the violin you’ve rented, or even purchasing an intermediate or
                professional model. You can even transfer the equity you gain in
                a smaller sized violin into the future purchase of a full size
                instrument.

                Assured Quality
              </h3>
              <p>
                When you rent a violin in “like new” condition, you gain the
                advantage of professional adjustment and tune-up. Before being
                rented out again, returned violins are carefully serviced and
                put into prime playing condition – and since they’re already
                broken in, this makes them even better than a brand-new violin
                for a beginner.

              <p>
                Just like any other instrument, the secret to keeping your
                rented violin performing its best is to make sure it’s well
                taken care of. To give your violin the TLC it deserves, check
                out these basic tips.

              <h3 class="umb-text--normal" role="heading" aria-level="2">
                Before Playing:
              </h3>
              <ul class="arrow">
                <li>
                  Tighten the bow. Look for a screw below the frog, and adjust
                  this to make sure the bow hairs are taut.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Rub the bow hairs gently with rosin. The easiest and most
                  effective way to do this is by running the hairs slowly back
                  and forth against the rosin.
                </li>
                <li>Make sure the chin rest is properly adjusted.</li>
                <li>Make sure you have your care kit!</li>
              </ul>
              <h3 class="umb-text--normal" role="heading" aria-level="2">
                After Playing:
              </h3>
              <ul class="arrow">
                <li>
                  Use a soft cloth to clean the violin strings. Look for any
                  built-up rosin on the strings and ensure it's removed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Loosen the bow hairs before putting the bow away. This will
                  prevent them from becoming overstretched in storage.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Always keep the violin in its case when not in use, and avoid
                  storing it in a place that's too dry or too humid.

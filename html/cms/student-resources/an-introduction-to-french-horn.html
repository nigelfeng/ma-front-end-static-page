                Rotary valves need to be oiled in three locations: under the
                valve cap, the bottom bearing down near the bumpers, and
                (carefully) down the valve slide tubes. There is no damage that
                can be done by using too much valve oil; never let your valves
                get dry and clanky. In general you should oil the valves weekly.
                On older horns the bottom bearing will require a slightly
                heavier grade of oil for quiet performance. Here is a short
                YouTube video that will help.

              <ul class="arrow">
                <li>
                  Remove each slide. Run warm water through the inside of the
                  slide. Empty all the water before putting the slide back in to
                  the horn.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Wipe off the outside of your horn with a cleaning or polishing
                  cloth to remove dirt and oils from your hands.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Wash out your mouthpiece under water to keep it clean after
                  each practice session.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Place value oil on your value at least twice a week. Remember
                  the French horns values needs oil in 3 places.
                </li>

                Metronomes provide a steady beat that helps musicians develop
                their sense of rhythm, and they also help players build up their
                speed by allowing them to begin working on a passage slowly and
                steadily increasing the tempo until their desired speed is
                achieved. Metronomes are one of the most important practice
                partners you’ll ever have, because rhythm is the one of the most
                fundamental aspects of music. Without a good sense of rhythm you
                won’t be able to play well with others or perform your own music
                accurately, so make your metronome your friend.

                Left Hand Position- Your left hand grips the horn over the
                tubing in front of the 3 valves. Use your index, middle and ring
                fingers; index finger on the 1st value( the one closest to you)
                then the middle and ring fingers will fall into place. Place
                your pinky finger in the hook below the 3rd value.<br /><br />Right
                Hand Position-The proper right hand position for the horn
                include cupping the hand slightly and placing it inside the bell
                so that the backs of the fingers to touch the inside of the
                bell, where the bell starts to narrow. If you picture the inside
                of the bell as the face of a clock, place your hand at 2
                o'clock. Also allowing for an opening of approximately two
                inches between the heel of the hand and the opposite side of the
                bell. For more information on holding your French Horn, watch

              <p>
                To play any brass instrument, one must “buzz” the lips in order
                to produce a sound. Put your lips together as if you were saying
                the letter, “M”, then pretend to spit out a watermelon seed as
                you blow air through your lips. Allowing the lips to “buzz”
                freely, without playing into the mouthpiece, will ensure a good
                sound when playing your first notes on your French Horn. for
                more information on playing your first sounds, watch this

                In order to be a good musician, it is important to understand
                the language of music, this includes having an ability to read
                music for the French Horn. Below you will some of the components
                of written music that each students must become familiar with in
                order to play music for the French Horn.

                  Notation: French Horn music is written in the treble clef
                  using standard notation. In standard notation, notes on the
                  staff will tell you which notes to play on your French Horn.
                  In beginning method books, the fingering is shown each time a
                  new note is introduced.

                      Rhythm: To convey rhythm different shapes and symbols are
                      used. The differences in shape and the beams and stems
                      indicate how long each note should be held. Here is a
                      basic chart explaining note values:

                  Time Signature: The top number in a time signature tells you
                  how many beats are in each measure. And the bottom number
                  tells you what type of note will receive the value of one
                  beat. The most common time signature is 4/4 also called
                  “Common Time”. When you play music in this time signature, the
                  quarter notes receives one beat and there are four beats in
                  each measure of music. All beginning lesson books for the
                  French horn help explain this idea as one of the first few
                  lessons.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Key Signature: The key signature tells you which notes are
                  changed to flats or sharps throughout a piece of music. Sharps
                  look like italicized number signs and flats look like
                  lowercase b’s. To sharpen a note, you raise the pitch of that
                  note one half step higher. To flatten a note you lower the
                  pitch one half step lower.

              <h4>Play Smart</h4>
              <p>
                Good practice habits are essential to the mastery of your
                instrument. If possible use a music stand and an adjustable
                height armless chair when practicing. Always sit with good
                posture and hold your French Horn in the proper playing
                position.
              </p>
              <p>
                As you begin your practice session, most musicians have a
                specific goal or goals in mind prior to beginning their practice
                session. I always starting your routine with warm-up exercises.
                These exercises get the blood flowing so that you can play your
                best and also provide you with an opportunity to focus solely on
                proper technique. After you’re all warmed up, you may want to
                start playing the studies and pieces recommended by your
                instructor/in your method book. While playing new material you
                are bound to encounter difficulties. I suggest working on these
                difficult areas slowly and not moving on until you have
                performed them correctly more than once. Before you end your
                practice session, you may want to end by doing something fun to
                play, like a favorite song you can play really well. It’s a good
                idea to end feeling good about your playing and how you have
                improved.

                Your French Horn should not be collecting dust all week until it
                is time for your lesson. For most beginning students, a
                reasonable amount of practice time is approximately 15 to 20
                minutes per day. Consistent practice is very important, in fact
                it is better to practice your instrument for 15-20 minutes most
                days of the week, than once a week for two hours. Intermediate
                players often practice anywhere 30 minutes a day and advanced
                players may play for more than an hour a day.

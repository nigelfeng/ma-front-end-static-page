                Guitar strings need to be changed fairly regularly, so it is
                beneficial to have a pack or two on hand at all times. Also, if
                a string ever breaks, having spare strings enables a backup to
                be easily swapped out.

                Rather than leaning the guitar against a chair or the wall—this
                is an easy way for the instrument to fall and get damaged—a
                guitar stand provides an easy and secure way to put the guitar
                down in the practice space. A stand is especially handy if the
                guitar is picked up and put down often.

                A case is essential for keeping the guitar safe and blemish
                free. A hard shell case offers the most protection. Any sort of
                stiff case that fits the guitar snuggly will allow the guitar to
                travel to a lesson or performances without damage.

                Students should get into the habit of wiping the guitar down

                maintain a beautiful, fingerprint-free luster for years to come.
                Wiping down strings after playing allows for longer playing

                Many guitarists stand up when they perform. For this, a guitar
                strap is required to hold the guitar over your shoulder and
                around your neck so that your hands are free. If the guitar has
                strap pegs on the bottom and by the base of the neck, choose a
                strap with a hole on each end. If there is no peg by the neck,
                get a strap with strings that tie around the neck near the
                headstock.

              <h3>Basic Guitar Maintenance</h3>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4>Daily:</h4>
              <p>
                <strong class="bold">Storage</strong><br />Keep the guitar in a
                case. A good sturdy case that fits the guitar snugly is
                recommended. When putting the guitar into the case, never leave
                the latches undone. This can result in the guitar accidentally
                falling out if the case is picked up before the latches are
                closed.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong class="bold">Temperature</strong><br />Because a guitar
                is made of wood, it can be affected by temperature and humidity.
                Try not to expose the instrument to extreme temperatures if
                possible. Don’t store it in a musty basement or a hot attic.
                Never leave a guitar in a hot or cold car, as this can cause
                serious damage.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Cleaning the Guitar</strong><br />An instrument will
                maintain its beautiful finish longer if it is regularly wiped
                down with a soft cloth. If there are a lot of fingerprints, try
                using guitar polish. DO NOT use furniture polish or anything
                abrasive. There are a lot of inexpensive guitar-cleaning
                products available that are perfect for cleaning guitars.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong class="bold">Strings</strong><br />Wipe down the strings
                every day after playing. This will remove the oils from
                fingertips and help the strings to last longer.
              </p>
              <h4>Monthly:</h4>
              <p>
                <strong class="bold">Changing strings</strong><br />Change your
                strings fairly regularly. If you’re practicing every day, it’s
                probably a good idea to change them at least once a month. But
                if there are challenges getting the guitar to stay in tune, or
                if the sound feels flat or lifeless, try changing them sooner.
                Never detune or remove all of the strings at once. This can
                cause uneven tension on the neck that can lead to damage.
              </p>
              <h4>Annually:</h4>
              <p>
                There are other maintenance items that should be taken care of
                by a professional. Here are some of them:
              </p>
              <ul class="arrow">
                <li>
                  Truss rod adjustments to keep the neck straight and even.
                </li>
                <li>Uneven frets can be smoothed or adjusted.</li>
                <li>
                  Bridges and saddles sometimes need to be adjusted to improve
                  the action or the distance between the strings and the
                  fretboard. A higher action can make it more difficult to press
                  down on the strings. A lower action can lead to an unwanted
                  buzz as the strings vibrate against the frets.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                After purchasing a new guitar, it is smart to take it to a local
                shop or service center and have it “set up.” A professional will
                adjust many of the items mentioned above and more to make sure
                the acoustic guitar is in optimum playing condition. It’s good
                practice to have a professional check the guitar out at least
                once a year to make sure everything is in tip-top condition.

            </div>
            <div>
              <h4>How much should a guitar student practice?</h4>
              <p>
                First, remember that regular practice is more important than the
                amount of time per session. For example, 30-40 minutes every day
                is far more effective than four hours over the weekend and
                nothing in between.
              </p>
              <p>
                Encourage students to practice at least 20 minutes per day or
                longer. It is also advised that you discourage sessions longer
                than an hour at once. This can lead to pain or stress injuries.
                If students want to play or practice longer, it’s best to take a
                break between 30-40 minute chunks of time.
              </p>

              <h3>Forming Good Habits</h3>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4>Sitting position</h4>
              <p>
                Acoustic guitarists should sit on a chair with no arms and put
                his or her two feet on the floor, keeping their back straight.
                If they are right handed, the waist of the guitar should rest on
                the right leg and the back of the guitar should be held against
                the chest and stomach. The neck should be fairly horizontal to
                the floor.
              </p>
              <p>
                The left hand should not be used to support the neck from
                dropping toward the floor. The right arm reaches over the top of
                the guitar body and helps to stabilize the guitar. Make sure the
                body is comfortable and relaxed and does not slouch over the top
                of the guitar. Resist the temptation of allowing the left elbow
                to rest on top of the left leg.
              </p>
              <h4>Left hand position (fretting hand)</h4>
              <p>
                The thumb of the fretting hand should rest behind the neck of
                the guitar. Bend all of the knuckles so fingers are curved and
                use the very top of the fingertips to press against the strings.
                Fingernails must be kept short. Fingertips should be placed as
                close to the frets as possible without being on top of the
                actual fret. The first couple weeks of playing will result in
                soreness in the fingertips, but calluses will soon begin to
                form, making fretting much easier.
              </p>
              <h4>Right hand position (strumming hand)</h4>
              <p>
                Rest the right arm on the upper part of the guitar body,
                reaching around the guitar. The right hand floats comfortably
                above the sound hole, and the arm, wrist and hand should be
                relaxed.
              </p>
              <h4>Using a pick</h4>
              <p>
                The pick should be held between the thumb and index finger.
                Place the pick on the side of the index finger and then hold it
                in place firmly with the thumb. Keep the rest of the fingers
                curved and relaxed. For small hands, it may be helpful to turn
                the pick so that a shorter side can be used against the strings.
                This can encourage greater picking control and prevent the pick
                from hitting the body of the guitar.
              </p>
              <h4>Pick strumming technique</h4>
              <p>
                Relax the wrist and move up and down along the strings bending
                at the wrist. Do not lock the arm and move only from the elbow.
                As the wrist bends, the elbow will move slightly as well. Strum
                down in a fluid motion, plucking each string along the way for a
                downstroke. Strum up in a similar fashion for an upstroke.
                Depending on the chord or desired effect, players may not always
                strike every string as they move up and down.

              <h4>Finger pain</h4>
              <p>
                In the beginning, the strings can hurt a player’s fingers. This
                is because in acoustic guitar playing, there’s a narrow piece of
                wire pushing against sensitive fingertips. There are a few
                things that can help alleviate this. First, make sure the
                “action” is not too high. This can force the player to push down
                very hard on the strings and that hurts even more! Make sure the
                guitar is strung with light-gauge strings. These are also easier
                to press and hurt less. Students should be encouraged not to
                press the strings too hard. They only need to press hard enough
                to contact the frets. Pressing too hard can cause finger pain
                and make it harder to transition from chord to chord.
              </p>
              <p>
                Students should play regularly, but not too much. We don’t want
                blisters! As they play, calluses will build up on their
                fingertips over time and it will stop hurting. Also, fingernails
                on the left hand should be kept short, allowing the tips of the
                fingers to easily connect with the strings.
              </p>
              <h4>Note buzzing or muted notes</h4>
              <p>
                The trick to playing guitar notes clearly is to press the
                strings firmly at the correct fret while not touching any other
                strings in the process. This can be quite tricky for new
                learners and often notes will sound muted and dull. Make sure
                that fingers on the fretting hand are curved at every knuckle
                and that the tips of the fingers are used to connect with the
                strings. Proper posture helps as well.

              <h4>Guitar size</h4>
              <p>
                Many young guitarists are physically too small to play a
                full-sized guitar. A 3/4-sized guitar may just fit the bill,
                enabling players with smaller hands and shorter arms to succeed
                at fingering and strumming their instrument. As they grow, they
                will need to switch to a full sized guitar. Even as adults, pay
                attention to body and instrument size. Smaller adults may also
                find smaller body guitars more comfortable to play.
              </p>
              <h4>Continuity</h4>
              <p>
                It can take a while for students to be able to change from one
                chord to the next fluidly. This can be discouraging. There are
                some chords that require very little finger movement and are
                easier to move from one to the next. For example, changing from
                a C chord to an Am chord only requires the movement of one
                finger. It’s important that students have some success with easy
                chords and can build from there. It can take several weeks or
                months before they can play many chords fluently, and this
                requires regular practice.

                Strings need to be changed often, especially in humid

                Also, if a string ever breaks, having spares handy gets you back

                Unless you’re certain you only want to play clawhammer style,
                you’ll need thumb and finger picks. A thumb pick should feel
                snug and stable. If it’s too tight, it’ll be uncomfortable and
                will probably break after a while. I keep a couple of spares on
                my brackets and more in my case.
              </p>
              <p>
                Fingerpicks usually need a little adjustment to fit your
                fingertips well. Once you’ve made them comfortable, keep them
                safely in your case so they don’t get bent out of shape. Since
                they’re metal, they tend to corrode and make your pick attack
                sound raspy. To restore their gloss and smooth sound, simply put
                them on and rub them on clean cloth. Again, keep plenty of
                spares handy.

                Wipe the strings and fingerboard down with a clean cotton cloth
                after playing. Removing sweat and moisture will help the strings
                last longer and to reduce sticky corrosion on your frets. Keep
                the whole instrument clean and dry. A little guitar polish can
                help you clean your neck and resonator. A small bottle will last
                a long time.

                Most players stand up when they perform, so you’ll need a
                trustworthy strap. Even when you’re sitting, a strap helps hold
                the neck up so that your fingerboard hand is free to play.
                Strap-ends attach to hooks on the rim or to the tension
                adjusting brackets. I only do that on lightweight student model
                banjos. For heavier banjos, the best option is a cradle strap
                which wraps all the way around the rim.

                nothing.

                Leaning your banjo against a chair or the wall is risky and
                unadvised. Your peg head and tuning pegs are easy to break and
                expensive to fix. If it’s inconvenient to put your banjo in the
                case every time, an inexpensive guitar stand will be a safe and
                handy place to stow it.

              <h3>Basic Banjo Maintenance</h3>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4>DAILY:</h4>
              <h4>Storage</h4>
              <p>
                To keep your banjo clean, dry, and safe, the best place for it
                is in the case. After putting your banjo away, close the latches
                so it won’t accidentally fall out if you grab your case in a
                hurry. Open the case on the floor, not up on your lap. If you
                try to lift a banjo out of an elevated case, the lid can slam
                shut on your banjo and hands.
              </p>
              <h4>Temperature</h4>
              <p>
                Because a banjo is made of wood, it is affected by temperature
                and humidity. Keep it where you are comfortable. Don’t expose it
                to extreme temperature changes, rain, or snow. Don’t leave it in
                the car, or the hot sun. Don’t store it in a musty basement or a
                hot attic.
              </p>
              <h4>Cleaning the Banjo</h4>
              <p>
                Your instrument will maintain its beauty longer if it is
                regularly wiped with a clean cotton cloth. If there are a lot of
                fingerprints, try using a little guitar polish. Don’t use
                abrasive cleaners or solvents. In the summer, I occasionally
                clean just the strings and fingerboard with a spot of 99%
                alcohol on a cloth.
              </p>
              <h4>Strings</h4>
              <p>
                Wipe down the strings every time after playing. This will remove
                some of the acids and oils your hand leaves behind and will help
                the strings to last longer.
              </p>
              <h4>MONTHLY:</h4>
              <h4>Changing Strings</h4>
              <p>
                Change your strings fairly regularly. If you’re practicing every
                day, it’s a good idea to change them at least once a month. But
                if the strings sound flat or dead or if tuning seems difficult,
                change them sooner. Adding fresh lubricant to your nut slots
                will improve tuning.
              </p>
              <h4>SEMI-ANNUALLY:</h4>
              <p>
                In much of the U.S.A, spring and summer humidity adds moisture
                to the fingerboard, which bends the neck backwards. Loosening
                the truss rod a 1/8 to 1/4 turn (counter-clockwise) is usually
                enough to straighten it. Fall and winter dryness requires a
                similar amount of tightening the rod. If you’re not comfortable
                making this seasonal adjustment yourself, call a professional
                luthier.
              </p>
              <h4>ANNUALLY:</h4>
              <p>
                Some maintenance is better handled by a professional. A new
                banjo usually needs a set up. Your bridge, nut, truss rod, and
                neck angle may need to be adjusted to improve the action
                (distance between strings and fretboard). Higher action makes it
                harder to press down on the strings. Lower action creates buzz
                as the strings vibrate against upper frets. Neck pitch may be
                increased with shims. Don’t try to fix it yourself by cranking
                hard on your tension rods! Damaged frets can be leveled,
                crowned, and polished, or replaced. Breaks or cracks in the neck
                or resonator should be repaired by a pro. Same for replacing the
                head or tuners.
              </p>
              <p>
                Again, your banjo will react to the weather. It’s good practice
                to have it checked out once a year to make sure everything is
                still right.

              <h3>How Much Should a Student Practice?</h3>
            </div>
            <div>
              <p>
                Practice at least 20 minutes per day. Regular practice is more
                important than the amount of time per session. Playing for 10
                minutes several times every day is more effective than 10 hours
                on just one day. This is supposed to be fun, and marathon
                sessions can cause injuries like tendonitis or carpal tunnel
                syndrome. Instead of sitting still for long periods, focus on
                one goal for a few minutes, then take a break. Return to your
                banjo with a new goal. Repeat, repeat, repeat...

              <h3>Forming Good Habits</h3>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4>Sitting Position</h4>
              <p>
                Sit on a chair with no arms and put your feet on the floor,
                keeping your back straight. Don’t hunch over and rest your left
                elbow on top of your left leg. If you’re right handed, the
                resonator should rest on your right leg, or between your legs,
                and the back of the banjo should be resting lightly against your
                stomach. The neck should be angled upward, with the peg head
                near eye level. Don’t use your left hand to support the neck. A
                well adjusted strap and the weight of your right forearm on the
                arm rest will help hold it up. Keep the neck a bit in front of
                you so you can see the top of the neck comfortably. Keep the
                banjo nearly vertical. Don’t tilt it so you can see the front
                better because tilting puts extra strain on your fretting hand.
              </p>
              <h4>Fretting Hand</h4>
              <p>
                Most of the time, your fretting hand thumb should rest low on
                the back of the neck of the banjo. Later on, you’ll use it to
                fret your 5th string. Gently bend all your knuckles so your
                fingers are curved so the tip of the fingers can gently press
                the strings. The back of your finger should not mute the
                adjacent string––short fingernails make this easier. Fingertips
                should touch the side of the frets without sliding on top. Place
                one finger per fret (index on fret 5, middle on 6, ring on 7,
                pinky on 8, etc.). The first couple weeks of playing may cause a
                little soreness, but calluses will soon begin to form, making
                fretting much easier.
              </p>
              <h4>Picking Hand</h4>
              <p>
                Rest your right forearm on the arm rest, reaching just below the
                strings. Rest your 3rd and 4th fingers gently on the head
                between the bridge and neck. This will help you arch your wrist
                enough to allow all the strings to ring.
              </p>
              <p>
                Pick upwards with your fingers and down with your thumb. Your
                fingers usually play strings 1, 2, and 3. Your thumb usually
                plays strings 3, 4, and 5. Strike the strings from at least 1/8”
                away and follow through while avoiding resting your pick on any
                string. Move your fingers from the first knuckle (closest to
                your palm), and keep your thumb to the left so it doesn’t get
                caught behind your fingers. Your picks should barely break the
                plane of the strings––don’t drag your picks across the head.
                Notice how the tone changes when you move your picks from bridge
                to neck.
              </p>
              <h4>Finger Pain</h4>
              <p>
                In the beginning, fretting the strings can hurt. Make sure
                they’re not too high. Don’t press them too hard, but only with
                enough pressure to contact the frets. Pressing too hard also
                makes it harder to transition from chord to chord. Play every
                day, but take breaks. To build strength and toughen my
                fingertips, I gently press my fretting hand thumbnail into my
                fingertips hundreds of times a day. Leathery callouses build up,
                and it hurts less. Again, fingernails on the left hand should be
                kept short, allowing the tips of the fingers to easily connect
                with the strings.

                To make clear tones, press the string gently right at the fret
                without crossing it or touching any other strings in the
                process. This can be awkward for beginners because sometimes the
                notes will sound muted. Playing too far from the fret causes
                buzzing, makes you press too hard and will make you sound out of
                tune. Make sure that fretting fingers are curved and that the
                tips of the fingers are used to touch the strings. Proper
                posture helps.
              </p>
              <h4>Banjo Size</h4>
              <p>
                Most banjo necks are longer than guitar necks, so the first four
                frets span four inches. Placing one finger per fret (index on
                fret 1, pinky on fret 4) may seem foreign and uncomfortable at
                first. It’s okay to start with your index finger on higher frets
                while you get used to the stretch. A good teacher will help you
                learn how.
              </p>
              <h4>Continuity</h4>
              <p>
                It can take a while for students to be able to change from one
                chord to the next fluidly. This can be discouraging. Some chords
                require very little finger movement and are easier to move from
                one to the next. Choose songs with easy chords and then build up
                from there. It can take several weeks or months before you can
                play many chords fluently and this requires regular practice. It
                took me two years to memorize all 36 basic chords. Be patient;
                have fun!
              </p>
              <h4>Lessons</h4>
              <p>
                Starting any new instrument is challenging. There are so many
                new motions to learn and details to memorize that it can seem
                overwhelming. An experienced teacher can answer your questions
                as they arise, help you choose fun songs and create practice
                routines that fit your needs and form good habits. Breaking bad
                habits alone is much more stressful and time-consuming. When my
                teacher tells me, “A, B, and C are better; focus on D this
                week.”, I can worry less and play more.

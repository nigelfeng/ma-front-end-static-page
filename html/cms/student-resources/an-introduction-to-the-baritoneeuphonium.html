                Valve oil is necessary in keeping the valve pistons ready for
                use. It is best to make sure the valves are oiled every day.
                Just like oil for cars, there are regular and synthetic types of
                oils. Whichever you want to use is your own preference, but
                don’t ever let them mix.

                A metronome is an essential tool for helping students stay in
                rhythm. Many metronomes you can find are also coupled with a
                chromatic tuner, which helps students keep their instruments in
                tune and to develop a sense of pitch. These are not included in
                the starter pack.

            <div>
              <p>
                The baritone and the euphonium are very similar instruments and
                you will often hear their names used interchangeably. The
                euphonium has a conical bore (meaning it gradually gets bigger
                throughout the length of the instrument) and has a more mellow
                sound, while the baritone has a cylindrical bore (meaning it
                stays the same size until the bell) which gives it a brighter
                sound. In general, both the baritone and the euphonium play the
                same parts, so whichever one you choose will be just fine!

              <p>
                Baritone and euphonium sheet music is unique in that you’ll find
                it written in either bass clef (like the music of a trombone) or
                in treble clef (like the music of a trumpet.) Advanced players
                will know how to read both, but when just starting out, it
                usually depends on the instructor which type the students will
                start with. Please be sure to ask the teacher which type you
                will be using before buying a method book!

              <p>
                Valves MUST be oiled every day before the baritone or euphonium
                is played. This involves removing each valve to apply oil to all
                surfaces. Spit should be let out before putting the instrument
                back in its case. Fingerprints should be wiped off the exterior
                before putting the instrument away.
              </p>
              <h4 role="heading" aria-level="3">Weekly Maintenance</h4>
              <p>
                The bottom valve caps must be removed and the interior of the
                valve casings are cleaned with a finger or a Q-tip swab during
                weekly maintenance. The caps themselves are cleaned with a Q-tip
                swab. The mouthpiece is cleaned inside, using the small thin
                brush found in the Starter Pack with running water. Soap is NOT
                needed or recommended.
              </p>
              <h4 role="heading" aria-level="3">Monthly Maintenance</h4>
              <p>
                The four slides are removed, wiped clean with a paper towel and
                fresh slide grease is applied to all the sliding surfaces. After
                reinserting the slides, wipe away all excess grease. The lead
                pipe (the tube into which the mouthpiece is inserted) is cleaned
                inside using the “snake” brush found in the Starter Pack and
                running water. Soap is NOT needed or recommended.

              <h4 role="heading" aria-level="3">3 Times per year cleaning</h4>
              <p>
                A full interior cleaning is needed periodically. My usual
                recommended schedule for students is Winter Break, Spring Break,
                and Summer. While most students are comfortable performing a
                full cleaning at home, a full cleaning service is also offered
                (for a fee) by the Music &amp; Arts repair team.

                Scheduling The Right Amount Of Time
              </h4>
              <p>
                For beginning students, it’s recommended to spend about 20
                minutes a day playing to build up the embouchure strength
                required for brass instruments. As students become more
                advanced, it becomes necessary to spend more time perfecting
                skills as well as staying in shape. As a rule, I recommend 20
                minutes for 6th grade, 30 minutes for 7th and 8th and 45 minutes
                to an hour for high school students.
              </p>
              <h4 role="heading" aria-level="3">Using your time efficiently</h4>
              <p>
                Proper practice technique is key to successful practice and
                mastery of music. Always sit down with a specific goal in mind
                rather than practicing aimlessly and without direction. Decide
                what you’d like to accomplish before you begin the session and
                work toward that goal. Focus on specific areas that give you the
                most trouble and slowly add more. Once you have your goals
                written down, write down a practice schedule and decide how much
                time you want to spend on each section. Be sure to check off
                what you have worked on to see how far you have come!
              </p>
              <h4 role="heading" aria-level="3">Where to Practice</h4>
              <p>
                Always use a music stand and supportive chair when practicing.
                This will ensure proper hand and body position as well as proper
                air support. Find a quiet spot where you can focus easily and
                avoid distractions. I’d also recommend turning your phone off or
                leaving it in a separate room.
              </p>
              <h4 role="heading" aria-level="3">What to Practice</h4>
              <p>
                It is always best to start with fundamentals. I recommend
                starting with breathing exercises to make sure you are using
                your air as best as possible, then long-tones to find the best
                sound, and lastly, lip slurs to build strength.

                A music stand is a must-have for all musicians. I have seen
                plenty of students try to use a desk or instrument case to hold
                music, but all this accomplishes is bad posture, bad playing
                habits and discomfort. The bass clarinet is a large horn that
                should be played sitting down on a sturdy chair in front of a
                music stand.

                Most bass clarinet mouthpieces are designed for use with fairly
                light reed strength, usually a 2.5 or 3. A reed will not last
                forever. They get chipped, broken, warped by everyday use and
                even the weather can affect them. Even if the reed escapes those
                grizzly fates, they will simply wear out over time. There is no
                hard and fast rule about when to change out a reed. The student
                will need to learn what to look out for such as difficulty
                playing, a reduction in sound quality and an increase in squeaks
                just to name a few. Reeds need a lot of playing to be broken in,
                so a good habit is to start playing a bit on a second reed
                before the first one dies.

                I am not a big fan of most reed cases because they are made out
                of plastic, just like the reed holder that the reed came in.
                However, they do help somewhat in keeping everything organized
                in the instrument case.

                The corks on your instrument need to be maintained. Cork grease
                comes in a tube that looks just like chapstick. Cork grease is
                applied by using your finger to massage the grease around the
                entire cork. If the cork feels dry to the touch or if the parts
                of the horn are difficult to assemble, you’ll need to put more
                cork grease on. When an instrument is new, you will have to
                apply cork grease often (probably every day), but as you use the
                instrument, the corks will become broken in and will need to be
                greased far less often. Make sure to wipe any excess grease off
                of you hand before playing your instrument!

                When practicing with a bass clarinet, you should sit down in a
                sturdy chair that allows for the peg on the instrument to
                support the weight. However, sometimes you might be required to
                perform while standing up. You cannot hold a bass clarinet while

                strap.

                Metronomes are great tools to help students develop a good sense
                of rhythm. But like any good tool, they only help if you use
                them regularly. I teach my students to use them when playing
                scales and other technique work at a minimum.

                Tuners are another useful tool for students, and they’re often
                conveniently paired in the same device as a metronome! Tuners
                are used to help a student learn about intonation, which is the
                idea that one player’s note sounds exactly like another player’s
                note of the same pitch. Alas, this is not always the case, and
                woodwind instruments are amongst the most difficult instruments
                to deal with this fact. Checking one’s notes against a tuner is
                a good place to start in mastering this concept.

                The absolute best upgrade for the sound for any woodwind

                difficult to play and to sound good.

                The bass clarinet is a larger version of the standard clarinet.
                Because most players start out on clarinet and switch to the
                bass clarinet in middle or high school, the anatomy of the
                instrument should be very familiar.<br /><br />There are,
                however, two key differences. A bass clarinet has a neck instead
                of a barrel, and the bell of the instrument has a slot for a peg
                on the back of it. The peg is there to support the weight of the
                instrument on the ground while player is sitting.<br /><br />Another
                difference on some bass clarinets is that the upper and lower
                joints are sometimes formed in one piece instead of two. I
                recommend that a student builds the bass clarinet from bottom to
                top––bell and lower joint first, then the peg, add the upper
                joint, add the neck and finally, add the mouthpiece. Make sure
                to assemble the reed, ligature, and mouthpiece before putting it
                on the horn.

                It is important to learn the name of the note, its fingering and
                place on the musical staff. A lot of students settle for two out
                of three. This leads to slower learning and communication
                problems with other musicians. After learning how to play most
                of the notes on your instrument, a good goal for any aspiring
                musician is to learn the 12 major scales. There is no better way
                to become a better player than to play though your scales every
                day!<br /><br />Strangely, the bass clarinet is a treble clef
                instrument! It plays and reads just like the B-flat clarinet,
                though it sounds an octave lower. This is a good thing because
                if you have played clarinet, you can pick up a bass clarinet and
                jump right in to playing it without needing to learn a new
                clef.<br /><br />Learning to read rhythm is equally important to
                learning the notes on your instrument! You must learn to count
                the beat (or a subdivision) while you play to ensure that your
                notes are the proper length and are in proportion to each other.
                I recommend to my students to practice rhythm by counting out
                loud (1, 2, 3, 4 – and later 1&amp;2&amp;3&amp;4&amp;) while
                clapping the beginning of each note. Counting out loud and
                clapping forces the student to do two things at once while
                building the habit of always counting.

                Making music is fun. The better you become at making music, the
                more fun it becomes. To become a better musician and to have
                more fun as a musician, you need to practice. In order to be
                effective, practice time must be goal-oriented. It is okay, even
                encouraged, for a student to have multiple goals for a practice
                section. Most productive practice sessions last at least 30
                minutes. 30 minutes can seem both like an ocean of time and a
                blink of an eye. To make the most of this time, I teach my
                students to partition it into at least three smaller sections to
                work on specific aspects of learning to play their instrument.
                These are tone and technique, etudes and literature. I find a
                roughly even distribution of time amongst the three categories
                to work well at first.<br /><br />During the tone and technique
                section of practice, the student should work on doing exercises
                that increase their ability to play the instrument well. An
                example of a tone development exercise is the long-tone. For
                this exercise, the student plays a given set of notes for as
                long as they can. Once bass clarinet students have learned the
                lowest note on the instrument, they can perform the register key
                exercise (also known as 12ths). To do this, they start a
                long-tone played on a low note, hold it for 6-8 beats, add the
                register key to fingering and hold the new higher note another
                8-12 beats. A good example of a technique exercise is a scale. A
                top priority of any serious music student should be to learn to
                perform all 12 major scales. The better a student plays their
                scales, the easier time a student will have leaning to play
                everything else they will ever want to play.<br /><br />The
                second practice area is etudes. Etudes are pieces of music that
                are designed to teach something or challenge a student in a
                specific way. Most beginner books are filled with short pieces
                of music designed this way. A good beginner book will have
                pieces that force the student to play in many different time
                signatures and keys. Ultimately, we practice etudes because they
                help us learn and apply new musical skills.<br /><br />The last
                practice area is literature. This includes the music that we
                either play for our own enjoyment or what we intend to play in a
                public performance. The music for your band concert, a book of
                Star Wars or Frozen tunes, an instrumental part to play with
                your church choir or a piece for solo and ensemble all fall into
                this category. As a student advances, they may add more areas of
                interest to their practice schedule such as sight-reading.
                Playing a piece of music well the first time is a skill that has
                to be practiced for a student to be good at it!<br /><br />One
                last note about practicing. I encourage all players to take a
                few minutes at the end of their practice session to play
                something that they really enjoy. Whether that is their favorite
                tune, a piece of music they learned four years ago or if they
                just want to make something new up, take a bit of time and just
                play the instrument.

                Most bass clarinets are made out a plastic or a composite
                material. Only the top line professional model horns are made
                out of wood, and even a lot of pro horns are composites these
                days. Neither temperature nor humidity will have a major impact.
                That being said, do not let the instrument get overly hot or
                cold as the pads can come unglued. This usually happens if the
                instrument is left overnight in a cold car or all day in a hot
                one of if left in an attic.

                Basic care for a bass clarinet involves two things. First, make
                sure the corks are greased when putting the instrument together.
                Second, swab the instrument when you are done.

                It is a good idea to have your horn serviced once a year. Going
                on vacation? Send the horn out to have a once-over. Bass
                clarinets have a lot of moving parts, screws, and springs and
                pads. Any of these parts can wear out over time and need to be
                replaced.

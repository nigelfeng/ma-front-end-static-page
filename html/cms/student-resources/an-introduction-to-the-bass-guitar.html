                It’s very handy for students to have a tuner to help keep the
                bass guitar in tune. Many standard guitar tuners have a
                bass-tuning mode as well. It’s common to tune multiple times

                Bass guitars use heavy strings and it’s not common for them to
                break, but it’s always a good idea to have an extra set or two
                of strings on hand. Strings will start to sound dull with use
                and the buildup of oils and dirt over time. As a rule of thumb,
                it’s a good idea to change strings at least every 3-4 months.

                An electric bass guitar will only make sound if it is amplified.
                It’s best to start off with a smaller bass amplifier that can be
                used for practice or small performances. Some amplifiers will
                also feature a headphone jack so that students can listen
                through headphones.

                When performing while standing up, it is necessary to use a bass
                strap that clips onto the strap pegs on the bottom and bass of
                the neck of the guitar. Bass straps are typically a bit wider
                than guitar straps and are adjustable so that the player can
                determine the best height to hold the guitar while playing.

                Depending on the style of music being played or the player’s
                preference, a pick can be used for playing bass. Many players
                like to use larger picks for bass. It is recommended that
                players try a variety of picks and see what feels right for
                them. Picks also come in a variety of thicknesses, weights and
                materials (plastic, felt, wood). Heavier picks seem to work
                better for a bass’ thicker strings.

              <h3 class="umb-text--normal">Basic Bass Guitar Maintenance</h3>
              <h4>Daily:</h4>
              <p>
                <strong class="bold">Storage</strong><br />It’s a good idea to
                keep the bass guitar in the case when not practicing. Make sure
                to close the latches each time so it doesn’t accidentally fall
                out. A good case should fit snugly and support the neck. Padding
                and soft fabrics keep the finish from getting damaged.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong class="bold">Temperature</strong><br />Never leave the
                bass in the car during extreme temperatures. Heat and cold can
                cause serious damage to an instrument. It’s best to avoid the
                attic or a musty basement as well. Keep the bass in an area that
                experiences fairly constant temperatures if possible.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong class="bold">Cleaning the Bass</strong><br />Cleaning
                the bass after each use can go a long way in keeping it in good
                repair. Wipe the body, neck and strings with a soft cloth and
                occasionally use guitar polish to remove all the fingerprints.
                Do not use furniture polish or anything abrasive.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong class="bold">Strings</strong><br />Wipe down the strings
                every day after playing. This will remove the oils from
                fingertips and help the strings to last longer.
              </p>
              <h4>Monthly:</h4>
              <p>
                <strong class="bold">Changing strings</strong><br />If the
                strings are wiped down after each use, they’ll keep their
                excellent tone and will last longer. Wiping the strings helps to
                remove dirt and oils from the fingertips.
              </p>
              <h4>Quarterly:</h4>
              <p>
                <strong class="bold">Changing strings</strong><br />After
                several weeks or months, the strings may start to sound dull and
                lifeless. It is recommended that bass strings are changed at
                least once every 3-4 months or more often if they are played
                very frequently. When changing strings, make sure to remove and
                replace one string at a time to keep the tension on the neck as
                constant as possible. New strings add a brilliance and punch
                that can make playing fun!
              </p>
              <h4>Annually:</h4>
              <p>
                A new bass guitar should be brought to a local service shop to
                be “set up.” A technician will go over the instrument and make
                sure that several features are in optimal condition, including
                the neck, pickups, frets, action and more. Then, an annual trip
                to have the bass checked over is advised to keep it in excellent
                working condition. Sometimes there may be issues with the bass
                that a professional should help repair or adjust.
              </p>
              <p>These include:</p>
              <ul class="arrow">
                <li>Truss rod adjustments keep the neck straight and even.</li>
                <li>The smoothing of frets that feel uneven or rough.</li>
                <li>
                  If it is very difficult to press the strings against the
                  fretboard, the action may need to be adjusted. The bridge or
                  saddle may be adjusted to improve the distance between the
                  strings and neck. Conversely, if the action is too low, it may
                  cause buzzing against the frets and adjustments may be
                  required to raise it up.
                </li>
                <li>Pickups may need adjustments as well.</li>
              </ul>
              <h3 class="umb-text--normal">Guitar Practice</h3>
              <h4>How much should a guitar student practice?</h4>
              <p>
                Regular practice can bring swift progress when learning bass!
                Daily practice sessions are far more effective than trying to
                cram a long session into one day. Students should set time aside
                each day to review lessons and to also have some fun!
              </p>
              <p>
                Daily practice sessions that last at least 20 minutes long are
                great to start. In the beginning, students shouldn’t engage in
                long practice sessions because these can lead to sore fingers
                than can cause painful practice for several days. Allow
                callouses to build up gradually. If a bass student wants to play
                or practice for longer periods of time, it’s best to take a
                break between 30-40 minute practice intervals.
              </p>
              <h3 class="umb-text--normal">Forming Good Habits</h3>
              <h4>Playing bass standing up</h4>
              <p>
                Many bass players perform standing up. To do this, a bass
                student needs to attach a bass strap with its wide end at the
                bottom of the guitar and the narrower end at the top. Position
                the guitar with the neck angled slightly upward. It should hang
                at a height that centers around belly button height, but see
                what is most comfortable. The left hand should not strain to
                reach around and fret the strings. Do not use the your hand to
                hold up the bass.
              </p>
              <h4>Sitting with the bass</h4>
              <p>
                Use a chair without armrests or a stool for practicing. Sit with
                the strap on and across the body. Sit on the edge of the seat
                and place both feet on the floor. Try to sit with the thighs
                slightly above the knees. The bass should be in a position that
                is the same or very similar to that when standing. The strap
                should hold up the guitar so your hands should not be necessary
                to hold up the neck.
              </p>
              <h4>Fretting hand position</h4>
              <p>
                Assuming that the bass is played in the more common right-handed
                method, the left hand is the fretting hand. Keep the hand and
                wrist loose and relaxed. Curve fingers and knuckles, and use the
                fingertips to push down the strings right next to the frets.
                Position the pad of the thumb against the back of the neck and
                keep the elbow close to the body. Fingernails should be cut
                short so they do not interfere.
              </p>
              <h4>Right hand fingerstyle technique</h4>
              <p>
                Many bass players use the index and middle fingers on the right
                hand to pluck the strings. The thumb should rest on the top of
                the pickup and the fingers stretch across and pluck the strings.
                Plucking higher up on the neck typically creates a fat, warm
                tone. Plucking further down near the bridge can produce a more
                bright and percussive tone. Keep the hand and shoulder relaxed.
              </p>
              <h4>Right hand picking technique</h4>
              <p>
                It is also common to use a pick to pluck the bass strings. Hold
                the pick between the thumb and the side of the index finger so
                that a corner of the pick sticks out. This is what is used to
                pluck the strings. Use a heavier weight pick. Either curl the
                remaining fingers along with the index finger or hold them open
                in a relaxed position. The pick can be used to pluck the strings
                in both the up and down stroke movements.
              </p>
              <h3 class="umb-text--normal">Speed bumps</h3>
              <h4>Size</h4>
              <p>
                Bass guitars can have very long necks that are much longer than
                their guitar brethren. Make sure to choose a bass that isn’t too
                large and hard to reach for the student. A shorter scale neck or
                a 3/4-sized model can be a better choice for younger bass
                students.
              </p>
              <h4>Finger pain</h4>
              <p>
                The fingertips on both the left and right hand can suffer when
                students start learning the bass. The fretting hand experiences
                pain from pressing on the strings. The plucking hand can
                experience pain or blisters from plucking the strings. Make sure
                to start with shorter practice periods until callouses build up.
                Encourage students to push the strings only hard enough to
                connect with the frets so that notes ring true.
              </p>
              <h4>Arm and hand pain</h4>
              <p>
                It’s necessary to maintain proper posture and hand placement so
                that students are not building bad habits that can lead to
                painful experiences later on.
              </p>

                In the beginning, it can be difficult to press each string
                individually without touching any surrounding strings. This is
                needed to enable each note to ring true. Students can get
                discouraged at first but should try to press with the tips of
                the fingers. Also check that the guitars action is adjusted
                properly to prevent buzz against the frets.
              </p>
              <h4>Solitary practice</h4>
              <p>
                It may be discouraging to practice bass lines without the rest
                of the song. Make sure students have recordings or other parts
                to practice along with to make practicing more fun and engaging.

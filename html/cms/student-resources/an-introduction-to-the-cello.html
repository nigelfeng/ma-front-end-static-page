                The metronome is an electronic tool that produces a steady
                stream of clicks. Metronomes help to assist the student in
                playing the proper rhythm at a steady tempo.

                A music stand is required for proper posture. If the music is
                not placed at the appropriate height for the student
                (approximately eye level), this will have a negative impact on
                the posture of the student. Improper posture also has a negative
                impact on the student's sound.

              <p>
                A notebook is great tool for success. With one, the student or
                teacher can make notes about new terms they learn, what music
                the student needs to practice, what the student's goals are,
                etc.

                Pencils are useful for writing in the student's notebook and
                also in their sheet music. It is best to make notes on music in
                pencil in case they need to be changed later.

                This is a soft cloth for wiping excess rosin cloth off of the
                cello. When rosin dust builds up on the cello, it can dampen the
                sound and will make the instrument sticky to the touch. Too much
                rosin dust can eventually cause damage to the varnish. A yearly
                professional cleaning is still recommended, but using the
                polishing cloth will help maintain your instrument in between
                cleanings.

              <p>
                Rosin needs to be applied to the bow hair at the beginning of
                each playing session. There are two basic types of rosin: light
                (or amber) rosin and dark rosin. Dark rosin is generally the
                recommended kind for cellos, due to how thick their strings are.
                This is because dark rosin is stickier than light rosin and is
                more effective in creating the necessary friction between the
                bow and strings.

                An endpin rest, also referred to as a 'cello doughnut', is a
                circular disc with an indentation. The endpin on a cello can be
                sharp, so then endpin rest helps protect wood floors from being
                scratched and carpet from being snagged or ripped. If the floor
                is slippery (tile, for example), the endpin rest will prevent
                the endpin from slipping.

                This is an electronic device that helps students make sure their
                cello is in tune before they start practicing. If the cello is
                not in tune, the student can be playing perfectly but still
                wonâ€™t be able to produce the correct notes.

              <h4 role="heading" aria-level="3">Pegs</h4>
              <p>
                Pegs are the four black knobs at the top of the cello. They are
                used for making medium to large tuning adjustments.
              </p>
              <h4 role="heading" aria-level="3">Fingerboard</h4>
              <p>
                The fingerboard is the long black piece underneath the strings.
                If the bow is played on top of this part of the cello, it will
                be extremely difficult to get a proper sound.
              </p>
              <h4 role="heading" aria-level="3">Strings</h4>
              <p>
                The cello has four strings. Listed in ascending order, they are:
                C, G, D, A. The C is the thickest and lowest-sounding string.
                The A is the highest-sounding string and the thinnest.

              <h4 role="heading" aria-level="3">F-holes</h4>
              <p>
                The F-holes are the two holes on the front of the cello. They
                help the cello project its sound, so it is important not to
                cover them up while playing. The f-holes on the cello are much
                larger than those on the violin or viola, so one must take extra
                care to make sure nothing falls in them.
              </p>
              <h4 role="heading" aria-level="3">Bridge</h4>
              <p>
                The bridge is the piece of wood located between the tailpiece
                and the fingerboard. It holds the strings up. The bridge feet
                should be resting flat on the face of the cello. There is a high
                side of the bridge and a low side. The high side should be under
                the C string and the low side should be under the A string.
              </p>
              <h4 role="heading" aria-level="3">Tailpiece</h4>
              <p>
                The tailpiece is located on the bottom front of the cello, just
                underneath the bridge. All four strings attach to it. It
                typically has four fine tuners as well.
              </p>
              <h4 role="heading" aria-level="3">Fine Tuners</h4>
              <p>
                The fine tuners are the little screws located on the tailpiece.
                They are used for making minor tuning adjustments. Turning them
                to the right makes the string sound higher in pitch, and turning
                them to the left makes the string sound lower in pitch.
              </p>
              <h4 role="heading" aria-level="3">Sound Post</h4>
              <p>
                The soundpost is a wooden rod located on the inside of the
                cello. You can usually see it by looking through the f-holes. It
                helps to amplify the sound of the cello and also adds to its
                structural integrity.

              <h4 role="heading" aria-level="3">Stick</h4>
              <p>
                The stick of the bow is the long wooden part. It is important to
                make sure that it is never too tight. The stick should always
                have a 'recurve', or should curve under slightly. If the stick
                is straight, or worse bowed over, it is too tight and will
                eventually warp.
              </p>
              <h4 role="heading" aria-level="3">Hair</h4>
              <p>
                The hair of the bow, traditionally made from horsehair, is found
                opposite the stick. The hair must be rosined every time the
                instrument is played. A cello bow that has not been rosined
                sufficiently will be very difficult play with.
              </p>
              <h4 role="heading" aria-level="3">Frog</h4>
              <p>
                The frog is the heavy part at the end of the bow. This is where
                the student should be holding the bow.
              </p>
              <h4 role="heading" aria-level="3">Screw</h4>
              <p>
                The screw is located at the end of the frog, opposite the hair.
                Turning the screw to the left loosens the bow, and turning it to
                the right tightens the bow.
              </p>
              <h4 role="heading" aria-level="3">Endpin</h4>
              <p>
                The endpin is a metal stick that extends out of the bottom of
                the cello. This allows the cello to be adjusted to accommodate
                the height of the cellist. The endpin also supports the weight
                of the cello and helps the player to balance the instrument
                while playing.

                Practicing the correct amount is very important. Practicing too
                little will impede the student's progress, while practicing too
                much can lead to fatigue, frustration, and even injury. An
                effective way to approach practicing a musical instrument is to
                do so the way you would with an intense sport: if you want to be
                successful, you have to work at it every day, but you need to
                start out small and work your way up. That way your muscles have
                a chance to build up without causing too much strain.
              </p>
              <p>
                common question is 'How much should my child be practicing each
                day?' Using the lesson length as a guideline is a good place to
                start. If the lesson is 30 minutes, you should practice
                approximately 30 minutes per day. Many students have difficulty
                focusing for that long, especially the younger ones. In that
                situation, timed practice may not be the answer. An alternative
                would be to practice each task or assignment 5 times. This would
                ensure that the student goes over everything the teacher
                requires while giving clear stopping points if a break is
                needed.

                  Sudden and extreme changes in temperature are bad for your
                  instrument. Although your case helps to protect your cello
                  from these changes, it is still a good idea to avoid exposing
                  your instrument to places that are excessively hot, cold,
                  humid, or dry. Extreme temperature changes put your instrument
                  at risk for cracking, separated seams, broken joints, and
                  snapped strings.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Cold â€“ You can take your instrument out into a snowstorm as
                  long as it is in a properly insulated case. It is best to
                  avoid doing so, however, unless absolutely necessary.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Damp â€“ Your instrument should never be exposed to excess
                  humidity. Too much moisture will cause the wood to warp and
                  the glue to break down. Make sure you are using a hard case in
                  these conditions, as rain can easily penetrate most soft
                  cases.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Heat â€“ Too much heat can cause severe damage to the joints and
                  seams of your cello. It can also melt the glue holding your
                  instrument together. Never store your cello in direct
                  sunlight, or in the car.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Dry â€“ Wood needs some moisture to keep its shape, otherwise it
                  can become brittle and crack. If the area you are in is
                  extremely dry, you should invest in an instrument humidifier
                  to protect it.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Earthquake/tornado â€“ If you live in an area prone to
                  earthquakes or tornadoes, never store your instrument near a
                  piece of furniture that might fall (ex: bookcases). A heavy
                  object falling on your cello, even while it is in the case,
                  can cause severe damage to your instrument.

                  Never stand your cello up against the wall. It is very easy
                  for it to slip, fall and break.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Do not lay your cello on its back. This makes it very easy for
                  something to accidentally fall in through the f-holes.
                </li>
                <li>Avoid placing your cello in walkways.</li>
                <li>
                  When getting up from your cello for a short time, rest the
                  cello on its side. This will keep anything from falling
                  inside. Also, this is a stable position, so it will not fall.
                </li>
                <li>
                  To get the best sound from the cello, it is recommended that
                  all the strings be changed at least once every year. Picking a
                  memorable date for your annual strings change (birthday,
                  Christmas, Independence Day, etc) is advisable, as it makes it
                  easy to remember when you last changed your strings.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If your soundpost ever falls, you should loosen all the
                  strings immediately and take your cello to get repaired. Never
                  play on a cello without a soundpost, as this can cause
                  irreparable damage to the instrument.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It is important not to touch the bow hair, as the oils on our
                  skin will make the bow hair dirty. When the bow hair is dirty,
                  it will not make as much sound. No amount of rosin can fix
                  this.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Dirty bow hair must be cleaned and re-rosined to be usable.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Never leave your cello alone in the car. Not only can it get
                  stolen, the change in temperature in an unattended car can
                  cause irreparable damage to your instrument. Too much heat can
                  cause the varnish to bubble and glue to melt, whereas too much
                  cold can cause the instrument to crack.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Always keep you cello in the case when it is not in use. Never
                  leave it anyplace somebody might trip over it.

              <h4 role="heading" aria-level="3">Practicing</h4>
              <p>
                It is important to make get in the habit of practicing every
                day. Some people find it easiest to practice at the same time
                every day. Others prefer to fill out weekly practice charts. No
                matter what method works for you, remember that students who
                practice daily consistently outperform those who do not,
                regardless of talent or age.
              </p>
              <h4 role="heading" aria-level="3">Posture</h4>
              <p>
                Students should be sitting straight while playing, with their
                feet flat on the floor. Slouching or slumping lead to poor
                sound.
              </p>
              <h4 role="heading" aria-level="3">Cello Position</h4>
              <p>
                When holding the cello, the wrist/palm should not be touching
                the instrument (aka, the infamous 'pizza wrist'). The left elbow
                should be kept slightly raised.
              </p>
              <h4 role="heading" aria-level="3">Bow Hold</h4>
              <p>
                While teachers recommend different bow holds, one constant is
                that the bow should not be gripped in a fist. If you are unsure
                about the proper bow hold, ask the teacher for help so they can
                recommend the bow hold that will work best for you.
              </p>
              <h4 role="heading" aria-level="3">Maintenance</h4>
              <p>
                Always follow the care instructions for your instrument to
                ensure it is in proper working order. This will help you get the
                most out of your instrument. Following proper maintenance will
                also help you avoid potentially expensive repairs.

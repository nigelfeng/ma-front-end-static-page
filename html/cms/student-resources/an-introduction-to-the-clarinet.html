                Good reeds are critical in helping clarinet students
                successfully create a good sound. Beginners will start on a size
                2 reed and move up in strength by half-sizes as they progress in
                ability. Beginner students will most likely go through reeds
                quickly as they learn how to properly place them on the
                mouthpiece and care for them.

                Reed cases help protect the reeds from becoming damaged and

                after use. There are several different kinds of cases that hold
                anywhere from 4-12 reeds that fit in most instrument cases
                easily. A student should have at least four working reeds in
                their case at all times.

                A swab is essential in the care and maintenance of your
                clarinet. It removes the moisture from the pads after each
                practice session. Excess moisture left on the pads after
                practice will wear away at the pads quickly causing them not to
                seal or possibly fall off. This will cause to instrument to not
                respond properly, or at all.

                This comes in a small tube that looks like chapstick. A small
                amount is placed on each of the corked sections of the clarinet
                when putting it together. Cork grease ensures that the clarinet
                goes together smoothly without excess force that can bend the
                keys. New corks should be greased each time the clarinet is put
                together. Once the clarinet can go together easily, the student
                should only need to grease the corks once a week.

                The Clarinet is made up of three parts: the headjoint, body and
                foot. When connecting the pieces, the hole in the headjoint
                should line up in a straight line with the row of keys on the
                body. The main rod on the body of the Clarinet should line up
                with the middle of the keys on the foot joint.

              <p>
                When putting the clarinet together, it is important that the
                student first grease all of the corks seen on the mouthpiece,
                upper and lower joints so they are able to assemble the clarinet
                easily. After the clarinet is assembled it will look like this:

                The Reed, Ligature and Mouthpiece
              </h4>
              <p>
                The reed is a small piece of cane placed on the mouthpiece that
                is necessary for producing sounds on the clarinet. It is
                important that the student wet the reed gently in their mouth
                for approximately one minute prior to placing it on the
                mouthpiece. This allows the reed to vibrate and respond
                correctly. The reed will not play correctly, or at all, if it is
                chipped or broken. The flat part of the reed lies against the
                flat part of the mouthpiece. It DOES NOT go inside the
                mouthpiece. It is held onto the mouthpiece by the ligature. The
                student must be very careful when placing the ligature on the
                mouthpiece to not chip the reed. Some ligatures go on the
                mouthpiece with the screws on the reed side and others are
                fastened with the screws on the back of the mouthpiece. The
                screws should always be on the right side of the mouthpiece and
                should be easily tightened with the right hand. The mouthpiece
                cap goes over the whole setup when not playing to protect the
                reed and the mouthpiece.

                  As the player progresses through their musical studies,
                  they’ll improve their ability to read, write, and understand
                  written music. As with any language, there are several
                  components that, once learned, will provide the player with
                  the ability to fluidly connect musical passages as well as the
                  ability to compose and arrange their own music.

                <p>
                  The following are four major components of written music that
                  students must become familiar with in order to develop as a
                  musician, play as part of an ensemble and to learn fun music
                  that motivates them.

                  <strong class="bold">The Notes:</strong> Every note written on
                  a piece of music corresponds with a fingering on the clarinet.
                  The notes on the staff will tell you which notes to play and
                  consequently, which fingers to use. In beginner books, the
                  fingering is often written out for the student each time a new
                  note is introduced. They also often include a fingering chart
                  in the book, normally on the first or last page. Each darkened
                  circle or key represents a hole that is to be covered or a key
                  that is to be pushed down. Sometimes both! These charts can
                  also be purchased separately to keep on the stand as a
                  reference. They will look something like this:

                  Some will have beams connecting them and others will have a
                  single stem. These differences in shape, beams and stems
                  dictate how long each note should be held for. Here is a basic

                  signature tells you how many beats are in each measure. It
                  also tells you what type of note will receive the value of one
                  beat. In most cases, the quarter note will receive one down
                  beat. If you were to tap your foot with the metronome on, each
                  tap or click would be equivalent to one quarter note in many
                  cases. The top number of the time signature tells you how many

                  <strong class="bold">The Key Signature:</strong> The key
                  signature tells you which notes are changed to flats or sharps
                  throughout the piece. There is a fingering that corresponds
                  with each note that is sharpened or flattened. To sharpen a
                  note, you raise the pitch of that note by half a step by
                  altering the fingering. To flatten a note, you lower the pitch
                  by half a step also by altering the fingering. A key signature
                  can have anywhere from zero to seven flats or zero to seven
                  sharps. You will never see flats AND sharps together in a key
                  signature––it will only be one or the other. However, you
                  could see a flat or sharp in the key signature and individual
                  notes altered to the other within the music. These are called
                  accidentals. Below is an example of what key signatures look
                  like:

                For most beginning clarinet students, a reasonable amount of
                practice time is approximately 15 to 20 minutes per day. Often,
                a beginner student’s mouth cannot hold out for much longer than
                that as they are still developing their embouchure muscles. They
                can slowly extend their practice time to 30 minutes as their
                endurance increases. An intermediate player should be practicing
                30 minutes a day and an advanced player 45 minutes to an hour.

                Proper practice technique is key to successful practice and the
                mastery of music. Always sit down with a specific goal in mind
                rather than practicing aimlessly and without direction. Decide
                what you’d like to accomplish before you begin the session and
                work toward that goal. Breaking the piece into smaller sections,
                isolating problem measures and slowing down difficult passages
                will always result in a successful practice session. Working
                backwards is also a very successful practice technique. Start
                with the last measure or group of notes and work backwards
                adding more on as you master each section. The piece or passage
                will come together very quickly!

                Always use a music stand and supportive chair when practicing.
                This will ensure proper hand and body position as well as proper
                air support. Sit up straight with both feet on the floor and the
                clarinet angled at 45 degrees or approximately resting on your
                knees. Make sure you are taking in an adequate amount of
                mouthpiece so that you are resonating correctly and filling the
                entire clarinet up with air, promoting the best quality sound.
                Embouchure (the way the mouth is sealed around the mouthpiece)
                should be firm with no puffing cheeks or air leaking from the
                corners. Fingers should be relaxed and curved, as if you were
                holding a can of soda. Make sure you are in a quiet location
                where you can listen to your sound, work with your tuner and not
                get distracted from your goals.

                Most beginner clarinets are made of plastic because it’s more
                durable for beginners and is not affected by the environment.
                This is also why students in marching bands use plastic
                clarinets. Intermediate or advanced level clarinets are made of
                wood, generally Granadilla. They are used in a concert band
                setting only and can be far more temperamental than plastic
                clarinets. However the sound quality, response and intonation is
                far superior. Live wood is constantly changing due to its
                environment. It is wise to keep your wood clarinet in a room
                where the temperature and humidity do not fluctuate to prevent
                cracking or swelling.

                The clarinet should be swabbed out after every playing session.
                Depending on the length of practice, pulling the swab through
                about five times should be adequate. Also, the corks should be
                greased about once a week. Always remove the reed from the
                mouthpiece when finished playing and place it in a reed case to
                prevent warping and chipping. Never force the case closed or put
                anything on top of the clarinet inside the case. Make sure all
                the parts are placed back neatly and correctly in the case
                before closing.

              <p>
                Your clarinet will last the test of time with routine
                maintenance! You should send your clarinet in once a year for a
                “tune up” to a certified technician, even if you don’t think
                anything is wrong. There are many tiny parts on a clarinet that
                need a routine checking-over. Pads will be replaced if they are
                starting to tear or are no longer sealing correctly. This can
                make a world of difference in the way the clarinet responds.
                Springs, the little needle like things that open and close the
                keys, can rust out and break off or lose tension, causing the
                key not to lift or close. The clarinet may also need to be
                regulated, which means all the keys might not be coming down
                correctly or at the same height or time. Wood clarinets will
                need to have their bores oiled each year previous to cold and
                dry weather to help prevent cracking.

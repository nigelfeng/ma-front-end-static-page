                A music stand is required for proper posture when playing the

                should be done prior to every practice session. It is also

                The bridge is the piece of wood located between the fingerboard
                and the tailpiece. It’s used to holds the strings up. The bridge
                will sometimes have adjusters on each foot that are used to
                raise or lower string height. Keeping the bridge in the correct
                position is critical because the bridge is only held on by the
                pressure of the tuned strings.

                between the front and back of the instrument under the G
                string-side of the bridge. It is very important that the
                soundpost is located in the correct position. It is only held in
                place by the pressure of the strings on the bridge. If the
                soundpost falls, detune the bass and immediately take it to the

                  Correct Playing Position Of The String Bass
                </h3>
                <p>
                  The bass comes in different sizes. The most common size is the
                  3/4 bass. The sizes range from 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, 7/8, and 4/4 or
                  full size. 4/4 basses are rare and very difficult to play
                  because of their size. All basses play and tune the same way.
                  Beginning age for the double bass is generally 8-9 years old
                  depending on the student’s height.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The correct position to play the bass starts with the player
                  holding the bass with the left arm extended holding the neck.
                  Then, let the neck come towards your left shoulder. The corner
                  of the back of the upper bout should come to rest on the
                  stomach area at approximately a 25-30 degree inclination. The
                  student should be standing in an upright position with their
                  weight distributed evenly on both feet. Keeping a good posture
                  is critical while playing the bass. The left hand should have
                  “C” shape with the thumb perpendicular to the floor while
                  using the fingertips to produce the sounds of the notes. The
                  left elbow should be keep up roughly even to slightly lower
                  with the shoulder while playing.

                    practices can be set at different times, but the time spent
                    practicing should be a little longer. A day off every now
                    and again is okay, but not practicing for three days and
                    then doing an hour of playing will not be beneficial to
                    learning. Your instructor will help put a plan together to
                    have a successful practice regime.

                      Always protect your bass from preventable accidents. When
                      not playing, lay the bass on its side with the bridge
                      facing towards a wall out of the way of busy areas. While
                      transporting the bass with or without the case on, carry
                      it with the neck resting on the right shoulder and the
                      bridge facing to the left. Do not stand the bass upright
                      against a corner. Do not put the bow in the “F” holes. The
                      bridge should be 90 degrees to the face with the feet
                      aligned with the notches on the “F” holes. Keep your bass
                      humidified during the winter months or in any extremely
                      dry environments. Keep your bass clean of rosin and dirt
                      on the fingerboard and make sure to loosen the bow after
                      each use. Have you bass checked out every year or so to
                      make sure everything stays in excellent working order.

                        To be successful at playing the double bass, it is
                        important to learn to read music. Because there are no
                        frets on the string bass, getting good intonation is
                        critical. Learning the different left hand positions for
                        all of the notes is best achieved by working with the
                        bow. The study of jazz, music theory and learning to
                        understand how music works is critical. Having a good
                        instructor is incredibly important in learning this
                        instrument. The string bass is a beautiful instrument
                        and is fundamental to supplying the foundation of many
                        styles of music. A good bass player is always in demand.

                comfortably. It shouldn’t be too wide, thin, heavy or light.

                Practicing at a performance volume and being used to the

                While practicing technique or musical passages that are
                designated for a specific tempo, the student should use a
                metronome to guarantee the ability to play a steady speed. It
                may not be necessary to use the metronome during the learning of
                new rhythms or patterns or during the more creative elements of
                practice time.

              <h4 role="heading" aria-level="3">Daily maintenance</h4>
              <p>
                In every practice session, make sure that the sticks are in
                proper playing condition. The stick should not be visibly
                cracked. For wooden-tipped sticks, the tip shouldn’t be
                flattened or damaged in any way. For nylon tipped sticks, the
                tip shouldn’t be chipped or cracked in any way.
              </p>
              <h4 role="heading" aria-level="3">Weekly maintenance</h4>
              <p>
                Evaluate the condition of the drum heads. Make sure there are no
                serious dents or cracks in any area of the head. It is also
                necessary to monitor drum tuning each week. Changes in
                temperature or moisture in the air can affect the tuning of the
                drums.
              </p>
              <h4 role="heading" aria-level="3">Monthly maintenance</h4>
              <p>
                Each month, sticks will most likely need to be replaced. As
                previously mentioned, sticks should be monitored daily and a
                replacement schedule should be decided on according to the
                natural wear and tear of the implement.
              </p>
              <p>
                Perform a topical cleaning of your drums every month. With a
                slightly damp cloth, wipe each drum to remove any dust or dirt.
                Directly after wiping with a damp cloth, wipe with a dry cloth
                to achieve a shine to the finish or covering of the drum. Also
                with a dry cloth, wipe all the rims and hardware of the drum.
                This will bring back their shine and also get rid of any
                moisture that has built up on the metal.
              </p>
              <h4 role="heading" aria-level="3">Bi-yearly maintenance</h4>
              <p>
                Every six months, take the drums completely apart and clean them
                using the same processes stated in the previous section. Taking
                the drum completely apart helps remove all dust and debris and
                also helps eliminate any moisture from metal hardware. It may
                also be a great time to replace the drum heads, but this should
                be monitored weekly and the proper replacement time is only if
                significant damage has occurred.

                Proper practice time and a consistent routine will guarantee
                progress on the instrument. It’s hugely important to develop a
                daily practice routine that is also fun.

              <h4 role="heading" aria-level="3">Schedule</h4>
              <p>
                If the student is taking a half-hour lesson, then it is
                important for them to practice at least a half-hour for each
                session. To ensure progress, students should practice at least
                four days per week. Practice should be divided into warm up and
                technical exercises, and musical patterns.
              </p>
              <h4 role="heading" aria-level="3">Measuring practice</h4>
              <p>
                Outlined is the minimum practice required for drum students to
                progress. Students who want to advance should take it upon
                themselves with the direction of their teacher to practice as
                much as their schedule will allow. The amount of practice is
                directly related to the level of performance of any player. With
                that in mind, it is important to recognize that playing an
                instrument is artful and exciting, and students should be
                motivated on their own to practice.

                It is very easy for hands to fall out of proper position while
                playing. Throughout the learning process, it is necessary to pay
                close attention to where fingers and hands are positioned on the
                stick. There are two main grips: traditional and matched (both
                are pictured below). In both grips, the fingers should be
                touching the stick at all times, the stick is to be held at the
                bottom third of its length and the grip should allow for space
                between the hand and the stick.

              <h4 role="heading" aria-level="3">Using the wrist</h4>
              <p>
                When playing, use more of the wrist and fulcrum to move the
                sticks. Too often, beginners use their arms to play. This makes
                the volume of the instrument too loud and harder to control. It
                also is a bigger movement and will make the player use a lot of
                energy to do a simple task.
              </p>
              <h4 role="heading" aria-level="3">Posture</h4>
              <p>
                Whether seated or standing while playing, it is important to
                have proper posture. Keep a straight back. Keep the arms relaxed
                from the shoulder to the elbow and parallel to the ground from
                the elbow to the wrist.
              </p>
              <h4 role="heading" aria-level="3">Using the pedals</h4>
              <p>
                When playing the drum set, keep the feet resting on each pedal.
                While using either pedal, your foot should remain in contact
                with the pedal board. Lifting the feet from the pedals shifts
                the player’s balance and makes playing more difficult to
                maintain.

                Make sure the snare drum is at the proper height. The drum
                should be level with the player’s waist in between the belt
                buckle and navel whether seated or standing. For drum set, the
                height of the drums and cymbals should be based on the height of
                the snare drum.

              <h4 role="heading" aria-level="3">Playing is tiring</h4>
              <p>
                Students should play using only their wrist and very minimal arm
                movement. Moving the arms too much can lead to using a lot of
                energy to play very simple patterns and can make us tire
                quickly. To properly play the drums, we have to build the
                correct muscles and stamina. As a beginner, it is good to focus
                on the correct movements and to play for the proper amount of
                time in each practice session.

                Developing the tempo to play a specific song can be difficult.
                It is a good idea for the student to talk with their teacher
                about the steps to playing along with a song. It can be fun and
                rewarding to play along with music even if the exact pattern
                heard in the song is not played. Students should feel free to
                play with music at any point in their development.

                When learning something new, it is important to take the time to
                start slowly and work forward until a musical tempo is reached.
                This will take a longer period of time for some patterns than
                others. Make learning easier by playing the pattern at a
                maintainable speed instead of trying the pattern too fast or too
                slow and feeling off balance or confused.

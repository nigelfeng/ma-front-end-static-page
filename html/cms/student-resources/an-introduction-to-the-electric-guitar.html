                A guitar turner is a simple accessory that students can use to
                tune their guitar. Sometimes guitars need to be tuned multiple
                times throughout lessons and practice sessions, so a tuner will
                make this task quick and easy.

                Purchase several guitar picks so that they are on hand at all
                times. Picks are usually made of plastic and come in many
                thicknesses. Try several to see what feels like the best option.
                Beginning guitar players often favor thin picks.

                There’s no safer way to put down a guitar than to rest it on a

                An electric guitar requires amplification for you to hear its
                sound. A small guitar amplifier, or practice amp, is perfect for
                beginners while a larger one might be needed for performance
                use. Some amplifiers have headphone jacks which allow students
                to practice almost silently.

              <h3 class="umb-text--normal">Basic Guitar Maintenance</h3>
              <div id="panel2b" class="content active">
                <h4>Daily:</h4>
                <p>
                  <strong>Storage</strong><br />It’s a good idea to put the
                  guitar into a case when it’s not in use. A hard-sided case
                  with a snug fit will go a long way to prevent damage. A
                  soft-sided case is also helpful for transporting the guitar to
                  and from lessons or gigs. Make sure the case is closed and
                  latched every time so that the guitar doesn’t fall out
                  accidentally.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Temperature</strong><br />It’s best to store the
                  guitar in a location that doesn’t experience wide temperature
                  and humidity variations. Avoid damp basements and hot attics.
                  Guitars can also be damaged if they are left in a hot or cold
                  car.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Cleaning the Guitar</strong><br />It’s a good idea to
                  get into the habit of wiping down the body and neck of the
                  guitar each time it is put away for the day. This will help
                  keep the finish fingerprint free. Try also using guitar polish
                  once a week or so to remove oils and keep it shining.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Strings</strong><br />Every day when finished playing,
                  wipe down the guitar strings with a soft cloth in order to
                  remove the oils left behind by fingers. This will help the
                  strings last longer.
                </p>
                <h4>Monthly:</h4>
                <p>
                  <strong>Changing strings</strong><br />After a bit of use,
                  guitar strings may start to sound dull or will become
                  difficult to tune. Changing the strings every month or so will
                  help keep the tone bright and full and will make it easier to
                  keep the guitar in tune. When restringing, remove one string
                  at a time and alternate from the low and high sides of the
                  neck. Never take all of the strings off at once, as this may
                  damage the neck.
                </p>
                <h4>Annually:</h4>
                <p>
                  A new guitar should be “set up” by a professional technician.
                  Bring the guitar to a local shop for them to adjust the action
                  (the distance from the strings to the fretboard), truss rod,
                  and more.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In addition, if there is buzz against the frets, uneven tone
                  or other issues, bring the guitar to a service center to make
                  adjustments. An annual checkup can help with some of these
                  actions:
                </p>
                <ul class="arrow">
                  <li>
                    Adjusting the truss rod to keep the neck even and straight.
                  </li>
                  <li>Smoothing uneven or rough frets.</li>
                  <li>Adjusting saddles, bridges, pickup height and more.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  This will ensure that the guitar is comfortable to play for
                  the student and that it stays in tune across the entire
                  fretboard.
                </p>
                <h4>Guitar Practice</h4>
                <p>How much should a guitar student practice?</p>
                <p>
                  It is a good idea for a guitar student to practice every day
                  for 30-40 minutes. A large hours-long practice chunk once a
                  week will not make up for skipping daily practice and can
                  result in painful fingertips.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Ideally, students should practice for a minimum of 20 minutes
                  per day or longer. Make sure they spend ample time going
                  through their lessons a few times each. It is advised that
                  guitar students do not spend more than an hour practicing at
                  once as this can cause pain or stress injuries. Suggest to
                  students that if they want to practice longer, that they take
                  a break after they have been playing for 40 minutes or so.
                </p>
                <h3 class="umb-text--normal">Forming Good Habits</h3>
                <h4>Plugging in</h4>
                <p>
                  Plug the guitar cable into the guitar and then into the
                  amplifier. It is advisable to have the amp off or on standby
                  and the volume turned down. Then, turn it on and slowly adjust
                  the volume tone settings. Electric guitars also sometimes have
                  switches on them which allow the player to select which
                  pickups are activated. Knobs on the guitar also often affect
                  volume and tone. Make sure the volume knob is turned up. Don’t
                  be afraid to play around with the controls on the guitar and
                  amp to try new sounds and tones.
                </p>
                <h4>Sitting position</h4>
                <p>
                  Many electric guitar students will sit while practicing. Place
                  both feet on the floor and rest the guitar’s waist over the
                  right leg. Hold the guitar against the body with the upper
                  part of the right arm. Do not slouch over the guitar, but sit
                  up straight. It is preferable for the left hand to not be used
                  as a support for the neck.
                </p>
                <h4>Standing position</h4>
                <p>
                  Many guitarists perform standing up, and if there is a
                  performance coming up that requires playing while standing, it
                  is best to practice that way. Get a strap and adjust the
                  height so that the arms do not stretch out so far that the
                  left hand has a hard time reaching around and pressing on the
                  fretboard. See what feels good and play at a height that
                  allows easy strumming and fingering without slouching.
                </p>
                <h4>Left hand position (fretting hand)</h4>
                <p>
                  Rest the thumb of the fretting hand on the back of the
                  guitar’s neck. The remaining fingers should all be bent at
                  every knuckle so that the very tips of the fingers make
                  contact with the strings. Keep the fingers short. Fingers
                  should press on the strings at a point close to but not on top
                  of the fret.
                </p>
                <h4>Right hand position (strumming hand)</h4>
                <p>
                  The right arm reaches around the guitar body so that the
                  player can strum over the area where the guitar pickups are
                  located. The wrist should be relaxed and when strumming, the
                  up and down motion should mostly take place at the wrist with
                  the arm moving slightly at the elbow. When picking individual
                  notes, hold the pick at a 90 degree angle to the neck and grip
                  the pick a little closer to the edge so there is more control.
                </p>
                <h4>Using a pick</h4>
                <p>
                  Hold the pick between the thumb and the index finger. The pick
                  should be positioned on the side of the index finger and then
                  the thumb will hold it firmly in place. The remainder of the
                  fingers of the picking hand should be relaxed and curved. The
                  player can adjust how far onto the body of the pick the grip
                  is to have the most comfort and control.
                </p>
                <h4>Up strokes and down strokes</h4>
                <p>
                  When strumming or picking the strings of the guitar, move up
                  and down at the wrist in a relaxed and natural motion. The
                  wrist should not be locked so that only the elbow moves.
                  Strings can be plucked in both a downward and upward motion.

                <p>
                  Your student may complain about their fingertips hurting from
                  pressing on the strings. This will go away with practice as
                  calluses will build up on the fingertips, but in the
                  beginning, this can deter some students. Check that the
                  action, or the distance from the string to the fretboard, is
                  not too high. Some students also press harder than necessary.
                  Only enough pressure to push the string against the fret and
                  allowing the note to ring out is necessary. It’s recommended
                  to start out playing lighter gauge strings, as these are
                  easier to press.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Students should play or practice regularly, but shouldn’t
                  overplay. This can cause blisters. Once the student has become
                  more experienced and calluses have been developed, they should
                  be able to play for longer periods of time if desired.
                  Fingernails on the left or fretting hand should be kept short
                  so that students can easily use the tops of the fingertips to
                  press the strings.
                </p>
                <h4>Note Buzzing or Muted Notes</h4>
                <p>
                  Early players may find it difficult to press the strings with
                  the tips of the fingers and to not touch other strings. It
                  takes a bit of practice for notes to ring freely without muted
                  or dull notes from other strings. Hands should be curved at
                  every knuckle and the wrist should be at a 90 degree angle so
                  the fingers come straight down at the tip and avoid other
                  strings.
                </p>
                <h4>Guitar size</h4>
                <p>
                  Young guitarists may find a full-sized guitar too large. In
                  this case, it may be a good idea to start with a 3/4-sized
                  guitar. These are perfect for shorter arms, smaller hands and
                  smaller bodies. Make sure the guitarist can reach the top fret
                  without straining and strum easily without having to reach too
                  far.
                </p>
                <h4>Frustration</h4>
                <p>
                  Like any instrument, it can take a bit of time before students
                  can successfully change chords or smoothly play a melody. Some
                  chord fingerings can strain and be especially difficult.
                  Students can get discouraged. Make sure students are
                  challenged but that they also have appropriate level
                  instruction and are given a chance for success with simpler
                  fingerings and patterns. Students should be encouraged to play
                  with others in bands and ensembles. Most of all, have fun!

                Flutes must be cleaned every time they are played. Otherwise,
                moisture build-up on the inside of the flute can lead to damaged
                pads and mildew, resulting in expensive repairs! Cleaning rods
                are typically included with flutes, but if you do not have one,
                they are an inexpensive necessity. They are also needed to check
                cork placement in the headjoint.

                See above. The cleaning cloth goes through the cleaning rod to
                swab out the inside of the flute.<br /><br />Please make sure
                you use a proper material cloth. Something that is both
                absorbent and soft without the risk of leaving fuzz or dust
                inside is best. Silk cleaning cloths are always preferred!

                No matter how much we swab out the inside of the flute, moisture
                as well as weather changes can cause the pads under the keys to
                stick. This moisture can be removed by placing a sheet of pad
                cleaning paper under the key and pressing the key down. Please
                ask your teacher to demonstrate because improper use can lead to

                since the slightest change in the direction or speed of the air
                stream as well as shape of the lips can make the note go higher
                or lower. Pitch is usually the number one challenge for
                flutists! A combined metronome/tuner device is highly
                recommended.

                The flute is made up of three parts: The headjoint, body and
                foot. When connecting the pieces, the hole in the headjoint
                should line up in a straight line with the row of keys on the
                body. The main rod on the body of the flute should line up with
                the middle of the keys on the foot joint.

                It is important to note how fragile the flute can be. It only
                requires common sense to properly care for it, but the flute can
                be dented easily if the student is not careful carrying
                it––please do not swing it around! The keys and rods can also be
                bent if they are held when putting the flute together. Note that
                there are areas without keys or rods on each section of the
                flute that can be held when assembling the flute.<br /><br />To
                hold the flute, make a "C" shape with each hand. The left hand
                is placed under the flute with the thumb on the key in the back,
                allowing the instrument to rest on the base of the index finger.
                The fingers wrap around, skipping the first and third keys, like
                this:

                The right hand also makes a "C" shape, with the thumb under the
                first finger and the pinky on the key on the smaller foot joint.
                The fingers must remain curved:

                Correct posture is key when playing the flute. Just the
                slightest change can make the difference between a clear sound
                and no sound at all!

              <p>Here are some posture tips:</p>
              <ul class="arrow">
                <li>
                  The flute should remain straight across your lower lip. Sit or
                  stand straight and tall.
                </li>
                <li>Do not allow the elbows to rest against the sides.</li>
                <li>Do not allow the flute to rest on the shoulder.</li>
                <li>
                  The chin must stay up, not down against the chest or shoulder.
                </li>
                <li>When sitting, feet must remain flat on the floor.</li>

              <h3>Reading Music: Notes and Rhythm</h3>
            </div>
            <div>
              <p>
                In order to play the flute, you must be able to read music. The
                flute plays in treble clef, so it is not necessary to learn bass
                clef. Each note is represented by one of the letters of the
                music alphabet: A, B, C, D, E, F or G. These notes can also be
                sharp (#), which raises the pitch by a half-step or flat (b),
                which lowers the pitch by a half-step. The rhythm tells us how
                long to hold a note. Use of flash cards, note and rhythm game
                apps or websites is encouraged. The sooner music notation is
                learned, the easier everything else will be!

                Beginning students should first try to produce a sound on the
                headjoint alone. It is important to note that the sound on the
                flute is produced by blowing across the hole, not down into it.
                The lips should remain relaxed with the corners slightly
                tightened (do not make "fish lips"). The air stream will come
                through a small opening in the center of the lips. Remember that
                it takes a lot of air to play the flute. You may need to blow
                harder than you think!<br /><br />Once you become comfortable
                producing a consistent sound, it is important to begin
                "tonguing" as soon as possible. This refers to the use of a
                "too" sound to begin each note.

                Flutes are fairly fragile instruments, so most care is common
                sense:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Do not swing the flute around or grab it around the rods.
                </li>
                <li>
                  There are many small screws and springs that should not be
                  touched until you understand more about the instrument. Please
                  leave this to your teacher or a professional repairman!
                </li>
                <li>Swab out your flute every time you finish playing.</li>
                <li>
                  Keep the flute stored in the case in a safe place, avoiding
                  extremes in temperature.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Keep the flute dry. The pads under the keys can be destroyed
                  by excess moisture.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Flutes should be taken to a professional repairman for a
                  clean, oil and adjust at least once a year.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Do not play with the screw-cap at the top of the headjoint.
                  That is attached to a cork inside the flute!
                </li>
                <li>
                  Have your teacher occasionally check the placement of the cork
                  in your headjoint and adjust, if necessary. A cork out of
                  place will cause intonation problems.

              <p>
                Proper practice is essential for the success of any musician.
                20-30 minutes a day, five days a week is the minimum amount of
                practice required to maintain and progress, although the more
                you practice, the more you will improve! Check with your teacher
                for personalized practice time recommendations. Use of practice
                charts and logs is encouraged, especially for beginners.<br /><br />Simply
                playing through band music over and over is NOT an effective use
                of practice time.<br /><br />Long-tones, scales and etudes are
                essential for all flutists. When a difficult passage is
                encountered, it must be isolated and practiced in bits and
                pieces. Your teacher can help guide you through different
                techniques to perfect these areas.

            <div>
              <p>
                Please keep in mind that it does not take much for something to
                be knocked out of alignment on the flute. Chances are, if the
                student suddenly experiences difficulty doing something that
                they were previously able to do, either a screw, pad, or spring
                is to blame. Have your teacher take a look. Many times, if you
                know where to look, it is a simple fix. Otherwise, a
                professional repairman can resolve the issue. Many times,
                student frustration can lead to quitting the instrument when
                simple maintenance could easily resolve any problems.

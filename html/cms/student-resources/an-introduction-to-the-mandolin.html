              <p>
                Learning to play any instrument is a challenging, time-consuming
                and occasionally difficult endeavor. Steel-stringed instruments
                in particular can be quite uncomfortable to play initially due
                to the nature of pressing the soft flesh of your fingers onto
                thin steel wires. The friction of sliding up and down can also
                be a nuisance while learning. These issues will dissipate with
                time as a player’s fingers callus. In addition, learning to read
                and comprehend music in its various written forms and
                successively turning what is on the page into sound is like
                learning to read, write, and speak another language. True
                savants are rare, and a great many students will have their own
                individual challenges and difficulties. Overcoming these
                obstacles is unequivocally rewarding, but this can only be
                achieved by practicing regularly. Patience and a willingness to
                invest the time and effort to study and practice are inarguably
                essential to the success and enjoyment of all students!

                Nearly as much, if not more, of the time that a musician
                dedicates to learning an instrument is spent LISTENING to their
                instructors and other accomplished musicians play. It can be
                difficult to learn how to “hear” written music. A series of
                notes written on a page can be interpreted in different ways.
                Once our ears have heard a tune, it can help make it much more
                natural and instinctual to turn written notes into audible
                music.

                There are eight strings on a mandolin, and it is necessary to
                keep them all in tune in order to achieve the correct sound with
                the instrument. A tuner is an exceptionally handy tool for
                helping players of all skill levels keep those eight strings
                sounding together harmoniously. There are free tuner apps
                available for most smartphones, tablets and computers that use
                the microphone of the device to hear the strings. I like using a
                clip-on tuner. It senses the vibration of the strings to tune
                them, which can be particularly useful in noisy environments.

                Once you've got all your strings in tune, you'll find it much
                easier to play them with a pick. While you COULD play mandolin
                with your fingers alone, the traditional sound and speed of
                mandolin playing is much more readily accomplished with a pick
                or, “plectrum.” There are thousands, maybe even millions, of
                different picks of varying sizes, thicknesses, materials, etc.
                There are even ones you can wear on your fingers and thumbs. The
                many different options offer various advantages/disadvantages
                when picking or strumming the strings. Your instructor can help
                to find the right pick for you.

              <p>
                As you play, the strings of your mandolin will become corroded
                by the sweat and oils of your fingers. This causes them to lose
                clarity and presence of tone, and to possibly even break
                eventually. Depending on how regularly you play, you’ll want to
                change your strings every few months or so, but it’s always a
                good idea to have an extra set or two on hand in case of breaks.

                A strap will make it much easier to hold your mandolin in a

                can certainly make properly playing a somewhat small and awkward
                instrument much less difficult.

                There are a few different approaches to reading and writing
                music for the mandolin. Mandolin music can be written in what is
                known as “standard notation,” which is the form most people
                would associate with written music. Mandolin music can also be
                written in what is called “tablature” or “tab.” Tablature is a
                system of numbers that represent frets written on lines
                representing strings. There are also chord diagrams which are
                visual aids that show where to place your fingers when playing
                chords. Your instructor may teach you any or all of these
                methods. Having your own blank manuscript book is useful for
                learning new songs and chords, but it also comes in handy for
                documenting your own music that you may write! The book in the
                link is titled as being for ukulele, but it is just as perfectly
                suited for mandolin.

                One of the most important aspects of playing music is being able
                to keep steady rhythm and timing. In order to ensure every
                member of an ensemble can keep the beat together through the
                entirety of a piece, great rhythm is a must. A metronome will
                assist by providing a constant beat with which to play along to
                at varying speeds or “tempos.” When practicing as a beginner,
                start with a low tempo on the metronome and as your ability to
                play the piece progresses, increase the tempo until reaching the
                desired speed. As with tuners, there are many free apps for
                smartphones, tablets, and computers that will provide a
                metronome. There are also some more advanced features to some of
                these apps that offer an accompaniment beyond a simple click.
                One of my favorite things to do with my iPhone when practicing
                with students is to use the Smart Drums in GarageBand to
                instantly create a randomized beat for us to play over.

                The mandolin has four pairs of strings. Each pair is tuned to
                the same note. The strings are tuned G, D, A, E, with G being
                the lowest pitched pair of strings and E being the highest.
                Because the strings are paired very closely together, when
                tuning, I like to use a pick to pluck each individual string.
                This provides a clear, singular tone for the tuner to hear.

              <h4 role="heading" aria-level="3">Holding the mandolin</h4>
              <p>
                As noted above, a strap will certainly help to hold the mandolin
                in an easily accessible and comfortable position. Without a
                strap, it is advisable to rest the mandolin on your left leg.
                You may want to rest your left foot on a small block or foot
                rest to help elevate the instrument. Tilt the neck of the
                mandolin at roughly a 45-degree angle so that your fretting hand
                will be able to comfortably fret the strings. It is ideal that
                you keep the neck of the mandolin not only angled up, but also
                parallel to your torso. You do not want the headstock of the
                mandolin pointing away from you, as this will make you need to
                stretch your left arm away from your body and to contort your
                hand more than necessary to reach a fretting position.
              </p>
              <h4 role="heading" aria-level="3">Fretting the strings</h4>
              <p>
                The thumb of your fretting hand should rest against the back of
                the mandolin’s neck. You do not want to use your thumb to
                squeeze the neck but rather as a stable support to your other
                fingers. The other four fingers of your fretting hand should be
                able to lay comfortably flat against the strings when not
                playing. When fretting notes, you should try to allow your
                knuckles as much freedom to bend as possible. You want your
                knuckles to arch, not bow. Occasionally, a player will use the
                pads of their fingers to fret more than one string at a time,
                but beginners should attempt to “point” at the strings with
                their fingertips.
              </p>
              <h4 role="heading" aria-level="3">Posture</h4>
              <p>
                Your back should be loose but upright. Don’t let yourself tense
                up, as this can negatively affect the fluidity of your playing.
                However, slouching can produce equally detrimental results. Sit
                up straight and try to relax your muscles in your back and arms.
              </p>

                Holding the pick/Picking &amp; Strumming
              </h4>
              <p>
                Different picking and strumming techniques are achieved by
                holding the pick in a few different ways. Oftentimes, a player
                may change the way he or she is holding the pick several times
                throughout a song in order to yield a specific desired sound at
                certain moments. Tremolo picking necessitates a close, tight
                grip on the pick, while jangly strumming can be accomplished
                through a looser grip.

              <p>
                Learning to read music is much the same as learning another
                language. Music for the mandolin can be written in standard
                notation for the treble clef. It can also be written as
                “tablature” or “tab” which is numbers representing frets written
                on lines representing strings. The figure below illustrates both
                of these writing methods and equates them to one another. It is
                a good idea to learn how to read both, as sometimes written
                pieces may only be available in one style.

                Practice should not be a chore! If you’ve made the decision to
                purchase a mandolin and invest time to take lessons, then
                practicing should be something you also look forward to doing.
                There is great reward in learning a piece of music. It can be
                frustrating will often taking a great many tries to be able to
                play a piece correctly, but it is also incredibly satisfying to
                finally hear those notes come out just right. Be patient and try
                not to get upset with yourself. Mistakes and fumbles are
                inevitable, and they are necessary stepping stones to mastering
                a piece. I recommend trying to practice or at least interact
                with your instrument every single day. Even five to ten minutes
                of practice a day is better than one hour once a week. The more
                consistent you are with practicing, the quicker your muscle
                memory will strengthen and develop. Too much practice can be
                harmful, however. If you’re really having fun, still try to give
                yourself a break every half hour or so.

                Marimbas come in multiple choices as far as sizes and materials
                go. From a 2.5 Octave to a 5.0 Octave (the most common is a
                4.3), Rosewood, Padouk and Synthetic bars are available. Some
                have adjustable height frames to to best fit the performer.
                Covers should be considered to protect the instrument when not
                in use.

                Beginning students should start with a pair of yarn-wound
                mallets graded as a Medium texture. This will cover much of the
                dynamic ranges that a beginning marimbist will learn. Rattan
                handles are common for this mallet of choice.

                A mallet/stick bag is a must to protect your mallets. As your
                skills develop, you’ll expand your mallet collection as the
                music dictates your need. Plan on purchasing a bag that will
                hang from your marimba for easy access to mallets when you need
                to switch textures.

                A music stand is more than just a music holder. It puts the
                music in front of the student at the proper height and angle.
                This promotes good posture and stance while giving the student
                the visual display of music, marimba and director all in one
                shot. Centering the music stand to the middle of the keyboard
                (Middle C) gives a good reference to the whole keyboard.

              <p>
                Like any other language, music has a written form to represent
                it. With so many published materials out on the market, a
                student can only benefit and grow when they can read and
                understand what they are being taught by a good instructor.
                Printed materials are the guide for at-home practice so the
                student doesn't 'forget' what their teacher covered in a lesson.
                They also help the teacher guide that student in their
                development. Folders and binders help keep everything organized
                and tidy.

              <h4>Pencil. Not a Pen</h4>

                Pencils allow the student to take notes and write on sheet music
                with the ability to erase markings. This is especially helpful
                for music that has to be turned back in after a performance.

                Always keep your marimba covered when you’re not
                practicing/playing. Generally, the manufacturer supplies a cover
                with your purchase. If not, order one or use a cloth big enough
                to cover it.
              </p>
              <h4>It's Not A Table Top</h4>
              <p>
                Marimbas can take up some floor space, but it is a fine and
                expensive instrument and it needs to be well cared for like any
                other instrument. Placing things on top of the marimba could
                damage the instrument.
              </p>
              <h4>Before practicing/playing</h4>
              <p>
                Before playing on your marimba, inspect the cords that suspend
                the bars above the resonators for wear and tear. If you notice
                fraying of the cord, order a replacement cord from your retailer
                ASAP for your specific brand and model Marimba. Once the cord
                breaks, the marimba is not usable.
              </p>
              <h4>Resonators</h4>
              <p>
                From time to time, something can fall and land down in the
                marimba’s resonator tube. If this happens, just remove the
                assembly and dump out the debris.
              </p>
              <h4>Cords Can Lose Their Tenson</h4>
              <p>
                At one end of each row of bars is a spring junction that helps
                keep tension on the suspension cord. Adjusting the cord's knot
                inside of each spring will renew the tension on the cord that
                suspends the bars properly.
              </p>
              <h4>Bars</h4>
              <p>
                Most companies today manufacture wooden bars made of Rosewood
                and Padouk that are lacquered. A quick wipe with a dry cloth is
                all you need to clean them. Bars not lacquered should be cleaned
                and treated with a non-wax lemon oil. Keep your instrument in a
                climate-controlled area of 68 to 72 degrees fahrenheit and 50%
                relative humidity. If you have to move the instrument to a less
                desirable environment, give time for the instrument to adjust to
                the performing environment. If your bars ever crack, they will
                need replacing. Bars can become out of tune over time. Find a
                reputable tuner for this or contact your retailer to order the
                specific notes from the manufacturer.
              </p>
              <h4>Squeky or Unusual Noises</h4>
              <p>
                As your instrument ages, it can create sounds that were not
                meant to be. The screws, rivets, metal and wood combined other
                factors will cause wear over time. Lubricate any wheels you may
                have. Check resonators for loose fasteners. Check your frame for
                any loose screws and bolts and tighten accordingly. If in doubt,
                send it out for repair.

              <p>
                During the beginning of your training there will be several
                things you will need to pay attention to. They are:
              </p>
              <h4>Stance</h4>
              <p>
                Stand at the center of the marimba and move side to side with
                the exercise at hand. A good instructor will address this.
              </p>
              <h4>Grip</h4>
              <p>
                Follow your instructor and instruction book on mallet grips. For
                two-mallet playing, each hand holds the mallet the same way.
              </p>
              <h4>Learning to Read Notes, Time signatures and Rhythms</h4>
              <p>
                Since the marimba covers a wide range of note voicings (for a
                4-octave marimba, it covers C2 to C7) you will need to learn
                both bass and treble clef music.
              </p>
              <p class="text-center">

              </p>
              <p>
                Time Signatures are note directions that look like fractions.
                They tell you how many pulses (the top number) are in a measure
                of music and what kind of note (the bottom number) is getting
                the pulse (or count). Lots of music is in 4/4. This is a time
                signature that means there are 4 counts of quarter notes in each
                measure. 6/8 would be six counts of 1/8 (eighth) notes. 3/4 is
                three count of 1/4 (quarter) notes.
              </p>

                  class="ae-img"
                />
              </p>
              <p>
                Rhythms are the values of a notes’ timing. Since you do not need
                to blow to make the marimba make a sound, this frees up your
                voice to count out your rhythms. Counting is crucial to being
                accurate. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 1 &amp; 2 &amp;
                3e&amp;a4e&amp;a1e&amp; 2 &amp;a3e a e&amp;a are accurate counts
                using quarter, eighths and sixteenth notes and rests. If you can
                say it, you can play it.

                This is where the metronome comes into play and counting out
                loud. Just like clapping to a nursery rhyme or a favorite song,
                tempo/time is so important in helping you become a better
                player.
              </p>
              <h4>Using Peripheral Vision</h4>
              <p>
                Unlike other instruments where you have hands/fingers on the
                instrument, the marimba and other mallet instruments depends on
                striking the notes while reading the music and/or watching a
                conductor. You will need to know about memorizing and/or reading
                ahead while you perform. It's not as hard as it sounds. You can
                read faster than you can speak and the same principles apply
                here. Glancing in your peripheral view will help you get the
                right notes in your performance.

              <h3>Forming Good Habits</h3>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4>How to Practice</h4>
              <p>
                Start slow. It's not a race. Poor technique sounds terrible and
                never wins you points. Getting your technique down will give you
                the skills needed to sound great. Sounding great wins listeners
                that will appreciate your talent.
              </p>
              <h4>Remember to Count Out Loud</h4>
              <p>
                Again, if you can say, it you can play it. It's that simple. Our
                brain is close to our mouth and we have used our voice longer
                than we have used any muscle in our body. Our limbs will follow
                anything we can say. Try tapping to the phrase "hamburger
                lollipop.” Without exact note rhythms, you can say a long and
                two short syllables followed by two short and a long syllables.
                Rhythmically, this could equate to the following: Quarter note
                and two eighth notes and two eighth notes and a quarter note.
                Count-wise, it becomes: 1 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4. Other permutations
                of subdivisions are possible.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another reason to count out loud is that is makes you breathe.
                Percussionists have a tendency to hold their breath when things
                get difficult, which leads to rushing the tempo. Rushing is not
                a habit we want as performers.
              </p>
              <h4>Dedicate the Proper Amount of Time to Practice</h4>
              <p>
                As with anything in life, we started with the very basics to
                develop our motor and auditory skills. Crawling, walking and
                running. Mumbles, gargles to speaking. It all took time. The
                same applies to developing our music skills. Dedicating 30
                minutes a day, whether altogether or broken into three 10 minute
                groups, is a plus to your development. No practice is no gain at
                all. "The more you practice, the better you get. The better you
                get, the better you feel about your performance. The better you
                feel about your performance, the more you want to practice."
                This is paraphrased from a friend of mine, Dr. John "Dr.
                Throwdown" Wooton, percussion professor at Southern Mississippi
                University.
              </p>
              <h4>Staying True to Fundamentals</h4>
              <p>
                If something isn't working, it is usually the failure of a
                fundamental. Technique and grips need to be looked at to be sure
                that is not the problem.
              </p>
              <h4>
                Use Your Metronome<span class="shop-now">
                  <a href="/Metronomes-Tuners---Metronomes.mac"
                    ><span class="ae-compliance-indent" style="display: none;"

                  ></span
                >
              </h4>
              <p>
                As said before, practice slow at first. Set the metronome to a
                low number to start with any new exercise or music you are
                practicing. Once you are comfortable with the passages, bump up
                the tempo by 4-8 clicks. Repeat the process until you surpass
                the required tempo by 12 clicks or more. This will guarantee
                that you can play the required exercises fluidly with precision.
              </p>
              <h4>Seek More Knowledge</h4>
              <p>
                Nothing will replace good instruction from a great teacher. Seek
                their knowledge and direction. It will make you a better
                musician.

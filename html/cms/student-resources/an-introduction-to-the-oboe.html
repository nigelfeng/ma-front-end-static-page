                A music stand is vital to your practice with the oboe. It holds
                your music and helps you to develop a healthy posture while
                practicing. There are many models of stands that come in a
                variety of cool colors.

                The oboe reed is the part of your instrument that generates
                sound when you blow through it. The reed fits into the hole at
                the top of the oboe. Your Music &amp; Arts store should carry a
                nice selection of reeds. Beginners should buy a soft or
                medium-soft reed to start with. As you build up strength in your
                embouchure (the way you tuck your lips around the reed), you
                will likely progress to a medium or medium-firm reed. When
                buying a reed, purchase one with a tip that has an almond shape
                that’s not too closed or open.

                It’s important to purchase a reed case. They come in many sizes,
                holding anywhere from 3-20 reeds. I recommend starting with a
                case that holds three reeds. There’s a slot in your oboe case to
                hold a three-reed case. If you leave your oboe reeds in the
                little containers that they came in when you bought them, they
                are more likely to get damaged or become moldy.

                A swab is essential to good oboe maintenance. Purchase a swab
                that has a string tail on it. This is so if the swab gets stuck
                in the oboe, you can pull it out by its tail. Run the swab
                through the instrument after every practice, putting the swab
                through the bell first and pulling it out the small opening at
                the top. Be sure to buy an oboe swab, not a clarinet swab, which
                is too big and will get stuck in the oboe. Check to make sure
                there are no knots in the swab or swab string before running it
                through the oboe or it may get stuck. Never force a swab through
                the oboe.

                Cork grease is important for putting the sections of the oboe
                together and for putting a reed into the top of the oboe. If any
                part does not fit easily together, rub a small dab of cork
                grease on the cork. If you force parts together, you run the
                risk of bending keys and damaging the instrument. With a new
                instrument, you should use cork grease every time you play for
                at least a week. After that, once a week should do the trick.

                A metronome is a device that helps you to count and subdivide
                beats. When using a metronome, it is often helpful to start with
                a slow tempo (how fast the music is going) and gradually
                increase speed as you learn the music. Many metronomes are quite
                compact, so you can put one in your oboe case and take it with
                you.

                note in tune (at the right pitch) or not. Easy to use, tuners

                An oboe consists of three sections plus the reed. The lowest
                section is the bell, which has that name because that’s what it
                looks like––a bell! On beginner oboes, there are no keys on the
                bell, just tone holes. More advanced models will have a key on
                it to cover the tone hole so that you can play a low note (the
                lowest on the oboe). Connected to the bell is the bottom joint.
                Above that is top joint.

            <div>
              <p>
                When putting the oboe together it is important that you use cork
                grease so that the sections slide together easily. This is
                especially true with a new oboe, which needs cork grease each
                time you put it together.
              </p>

            <div>
              <p>
                The finger keys on the oboe should be in a straight line when
                the oboe is put together. There are metal tabs on either side of
                the instrument where the top and bottom joints meet that should
                line up. The tabs on the bottom joint need to be gently slid
                under the tabs on the top joint when putting the oboe together.
                Never force the oboe together if the tabs are hitting one
                another or you will bend the keys. Do not hold the oboe too
                firmly when putting the oboe together or you can bend keys and
                rods.

                Oboe reeds are fragile things. You need to handle them carefully
                or they will chip or crack. Always soak the reed for 3-4 minutes
                in room temperature water before playing on it. The reed should
                be placed in a small glass of water tip down, and the water
                should go up to where the cane (the wood part) stops and the
                string begins. Once the reed is soaked, put cork grease on the
                cork base of the reed and put it in as far as it will go in the
                opening at the top of the oboe. Hold the reed on the string (not
                the cane) when installing or removing it from the oboe. The flat
                part of the reed should line up with the keys on the top of the
                oboe. When placing the oboe reed in your mouth, rest the flat
                part of the tip of the reed on your tucked in bottom lip, then
                gently (do not bit down) close the tucked in upper lip over the
                reed. Now you’re ready to play!

                Learning to read music is like learning a language. The notes
                are like words and the phrases are like sentences. As you get
                better at playing the oboe, you will learn the grammar of music
                such as when to take a breath, when to get louder and softer and
                when to play a note long or short. Playing louder and softer is
                called dynamics, and that’s part of what makes listening to
                music interesting.

                The oboe is considered by many musicians to be a challenging
                wind instrument to play. This is because the opening that you
                blow through on the reed is very small, and it takes a lot of
                air pressure and support to produce a good sound. Deep breath
                and air support are necessary in order to sound good on this
                instrument.

              <p>
                Also, because the reed is small, your embouchure (how you tuck
                in the lips) may get tired when you start playing. If your lips
                give out, even if you’ve only been playing for a few minutes,
                take a break and come back to practicing the oboe later. Pretty
                soon, you’ll build up your endurance to the point where you can
                play for 15 minutes, then 30 minutes, and even longer!

                When practicing, sit in a straight-backed chair. Don’t slouch,
                cross your legs, or lean back. Hold the oboe out a 45 degree
                angle from your body. Keep your fingers close to the keys and
                don’t look at them when playing music. This will help you to
                memorize fingerings.

                In order to get a good sound on the oboe, do not bite down on
                the reed. Having a good embouchure is one of the most important
                aspects of sounding good on the oboe. Your lips should be tucked
                around the reed, but do not apply too much pressure on the reed
                so that it can vibrate freely and make a good sound.

                Start your warm up with long-tones. See if you can hold a note
                and have it sound steady for 10-15 seconds. This will build up
                your endurance. Then, move on to playing long-tone scales. This
                is a great exercise for developing a nice tone and endurance.

                A beginning oboe student should practice for 15 to 20 minutes a
                day. Intermediate oboists should practice 30 minutes a day, and
                advanced students should aim for 45 minutes to an hour of
                practice each day. Advanced students may also be introduced by
                their teacher to reed making. Most professional oboists make
                their own reeds, and typically they start learning how to do
                this while still in high school.

                Practice without distractions. That means going to a quiet room
                and not texting, gaming, watching TV or multi-tasking while
                playing the oboe. You’ll make much better use of your practice
                time if you stay focused on the task at hand––practice! Before
                you know it, you’ll be playing fun melodies, working on solos,
                and playing in your school band or orchestra.

                Decide on what it is you want to accomplish during your practice
                time. In general, it’s better to focus on a small section of
                your music to get it right rather than to play through all your
                music without setting any goal. Once you’ve learned how to play
                a small part of a piece, then move on to the next small part and
                then string the parts together. Before you know it, you’ll have
                learned how to play an entire piece of music!

                Most beginner oboes are made of plastic. Plastic is more durable
                for beginners than wood and is not negatively affected by heat
                or cold. Wood oboes generally have a better sound than plastic
                ones and are used by intermediate and advanced students, but if
                a wood oboe is not properly looked after, it can crack. It’s
                especially prone to cracking if you play on a cold oboe without
                first warming it up. Some oboe makers are now putting plastic
                liners in the top joints of wood oboes, which has the benefit of
                making an oboe less prone to cracking while giving you the
                warmer sound of a wood instrument. Most wood oboes are made from
                granadilla wood, a dark colored and dense wood that grows in
                Africa.

                The oboe should be swabbed out after every playing session.
                Always run the swab through the instrument from bottom (bell) to
                top. Only use swabs that have a string tail, so that the swab
                can be extracted by pulling it back out should it get caught in
                the instrument. Be sure to check that there are no knots in the
                swab before using it and never force a swab through the oboe
              </p>

            <div>
              <p>
                Remember to use cork grease if your oboe is not going together
                easily. Store your reeds in a reed case, not in the plastic
                tubes that store-bought reeds come in. Be sure the oboe is
                properly in its case before closing the case. Never force a case
                closed.

                Oboes need routine maintenance in order to play properly. Take
                your oboe in to an experienced woodwind technician once a year
                to check pads, springs and keys. When your oboe is properly
                maintained it will play much more easily for you than if it is
                out of adjustment. Once every six months, you, your private
                teacher or your band director should apply some bore oil to the
                inside of oboe if it is made of wood. This will help to prevent
                cracking and warping. Make sure the corks that hold the three
                sections of the oboe together are in good shape or have them
                replaced.

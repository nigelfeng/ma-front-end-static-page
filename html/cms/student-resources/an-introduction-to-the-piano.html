                only helpful to the teacher who will help keep track of your
                progress, but also in helping you develop a sense of routine and
                to keep track of what you may need any extra help with.

              <h3>About Your Keyboard: The Three Pedals</h3>
            </div>
            <div>
              <p>
                On almost any upright, grand, or digital piano, there are three
                pedals located underneath the keyboard. Each pedal has a
                specific function that changes the sound of the notes played
                depending on how and when the pedals are utilized.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Right Pedal</strong> (also called the sustain or the
                  damper pedal)
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Middle Pedal</strong> (also called the sostenuto
                  pedal)
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Left Pedal</strong> (called the soft pedal or the una
                  corda pedal)
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h4>The Function of the Soft Pedal</h4>
              <p>The soft pedal gives a soft and distant sound to the piano.</p>
              <h4>The Function of the Sostenuto Pedal</h4>
              <p>
                This pedal allows certain notes to be sustained (or held out)
                while other notes on the keyboard are unaffected. It’s used by
                hitting the desired notes, then depressing the pedal. The
                selected notes will resonate until pedal is released.
              </p>
              <h4>The Functions of the Sustain Pedal</h4>
              <p>
                This pedal allows the sound to continue even after you have
                stopped pressing the keys. This changes the timbre of the pitch,
                making it fuller or warmer.

            <div>
              <p>
                As the player progresses through their musical studies, they’ll
                improve their ability to read, write and understand written
                music. As with any language, there are several components that,
                once learned, will give the player the ability to fluidly
                connect musical passages and to compose and arrange their own
                music.
              </p>
              <h4>The Components</h4>
              <p>
                The following are the three major components of written music
                that students must become familiar with in order to become
                comfortable with working with sheet music:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>The Notes:</strong> Every note written on sheet music
                  or staff paper corresponds to a key on the keyboard. The notes
                  on the music will tell you which notes to play.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>The Rhythms:</strong> Each note will be a certain
                  shape and color. These differences in shape and color dictate
                  how long each note should be held for.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>The Time Signatures:</strong> The time signature tells
                  you how many beats are in each measure. This will give you the
                  “feel” for how a piece is to be played.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Just as the note names on the keyboard and staff are fundamental
                to reading music, following a rhythm ensures that each pitch or
                rest has the correct duration throughout time. A time signature
                informs the musician of how many beats are located in a measure
                and what note receives the beat.
              </p>
              <p>

                the major components:

                <li>
                  Sharps (#) and flats (b) can be added to any note. This will

            <div>
              <h4>Scheduling the right amount of time</h4>
              <p>
                For most piano studios, a reasonable amount of practice is
                approximately 30 minutes per day. For some students, especially
                children, one to two short sessions of 10-15 minutes per day is
                usually much more effective.
              </p>
              <h4>Using Your Time Efficiently</h4>
              <p>
                Musicians must be diligent regarding their practice time.
                Younger students are encouraged to visit the piano more often in
                smaller increments of time to ensure that their physical need to
                “move” is met. At any age, sitting at the piano should be
                productive at every juncture.
              </p>
              <p>
                Students are encouraged to practice rigorous sections more
                often, leaving the simpler passages to a later time where the
                piece of music can be ‘pasted’ back together.
              </p>
              <h4>Practice Logs And Charts</h4>
              <p>
                Practicing with the correct posture will lead not only to
                correct acquisition of skills, but a healthy routine as well.
                Playing with incorrect posture and hand placement can lead to

                Most pianos are made of natural live wood that is constantly
                changing due to its environment. It is wise to keep your piano
                in a room where the temperature and humidity do not fluctuate.

                may be required for your instrument––ask your technician! A
                piano should never be left in a dry room.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Avoid placing heavy objects on your instrument.</li>
                <li>
                  Liquids should not be placed on the piano to avoid spills.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Keeping your piano away from windows and direct sunlight will
                  keep your instrument in pristine condition for years of
                  enjoyment.

              <p>
                To clean your acoustic piano, you will need a soft cloth that
                has nothing abrasive (no tags, edges, etc.) on or around the
                fabric. Use this cloth with non-abrasive cleaner to clean a
                high-gloss or matte-based instrument.
              </p>
              <p>
                To clean your digital piano, consider using a commercial spray
                or cleaner for digital piano keyboards only. These products are
                available from Music and Arts, both in-store and online
              </p>
              <h4>2 Times per year tuning</h4>
              <p>
                Your piano will last the test of time with routine maintenance!
                A piano should be tuned twice a year by a certified technician.
                Once you have a piano technician visiting your instrument,
                they’ll assess and “mend” issues focusing on voicing, tuning,
                and action.

                Condensation buildup is a common occurrence on the piccolo. The
                instrument should be swabbed frequently during use and after in
                order to avoid watery keys, damaged pads and mildew, all of
                which could lead to expensive repairs. The cleaning rod is also
                used to check the placement of the headjoint cork.

                It is very important to purchase a soft, absorbent cleaning
                cloth specifically meant to swab the inside of the piccolo. This
                instrument is very small and you don’t want to get a large cloth
                stuck inside the instrument during the cleaning process.

              <p>
                Even with constant swabbing, piccolos tend to collect water in
                the keys and pads. Moisture can be removed by placing a sheet of
                cleaning paper between the instrument and the key. Once the
                paper is in place, gently close and open the key. Pulling the
                paper while pressing a key can lead to torn pads, so please ask
                your teacher for assistance.

                The various types of technology available to us today plays a
                vital role in music instruction. Some method books include
                supplemental materials such as CDs, audio access resources,
                instructional videos and downloadable documents. Using these
                additional resources will enrich your experience learning the
                piccolo.

                Pitch is one of the most challenging aspects of playing the
                piccolo. Every piccolo player should own a tuner and use it
                regularly to learn how to play each note on the instrument in
                tune. This device will tell you the pitch you are playing and if
                that note is sharp or flat. By playing with a tuner, the student
                will learn how to adjust their embouchure and air stream for
                each note. A piccolo player can also use this device to train
                the ear to hear and match pitch.

                The piccolo consists of two parts: the headjoint and the body.
                When assembling your piccolo, be sure to handle each piece with
                care. Hold the headjoint firmly in one hand and the barrel of
                the body in the other. Using a gentle twisting motion, assemble
                the instrument with a “straight on” approach, not from an angle.
                The embouchure hole should be aligned with the row of keys on
                the body.

                The right hand should also form a “C” shape. The thumb will rest
                under the instrument between the index and middle finger while
                curved fingers rest on the keys. The palm faces the floor. Make
                sure the right thumb doesn’t protrude. The right hand should not
                lean forward or hang on the rods.

                Correct posture for the piccolo

                Correct posture is critical for proper piccolo playing. Always
                bring the piccolo to you, not the other way around. There are
                four points of balance when holding the piccolo: the chin, the
                base of left hand index finger, the right hand thumb and the
                right hand pinky. The fingers should hover over the keys at all
                times in a relaxed and ready position. This includes the left
                hand pinky. Press the keys with the “fleshy” pads of the
                fingers. Avoid squeezing the keys to produce sound, and avoid
                any excess up and down motion with the fingers. Use good posture
                while sitting and standing. If you plan to sit while playing,
                use a straight-backed chair and sit up tall on the edge of your
                seat with both feet flat on the floor about shoulder-width
                apart. When standing, the feet should remain shoulder width
                apart. The right foot should be slightly behind the left,
                creating a 45-degree angle. The piccolo should be positioned
                straight on the chin and remain parallel to the floor. The chin
                should also remain parallel to the ground to maintain an open
                throat and airway. Avoid squeezing the ribcage. Your shoulders
                should be relaxed and the neck long. Adjust the music stand to
                your posture and height, not the other way around.

                Reading Music: Notes and Rhythm

              <p>
                Reading music is similar to learning how to read in another
                language. First we must be able to identify individual notes or
                words and will eventually become fluent enough to form phrases
                or sentences. As the student continues to grow and develop, so
                does their musical language. They will not only learn how to
                read notes, but other music fundamentals as well like rhythms,
                time signatures, key signatures, dynamics, articulations, tempo
                markings, etc. Reading music is a critical skill for anyone
                interested in learning how to play the piccolo. All music
                composed for piccolo is written in treble clef. It is also
                important to know that the piccolo sounds an octave higher than
                written. Practice your reading skills as often as possible using
                flash cards, websites, and helpful apps in order to improve
                reading skills and gain true mastery.

                Tone is the most important element in piccolo playing. Most
                piccolo players have studied flute before learning how to play
                the piccolo. Like the flute, sound is produced on the piccolo by
                blowing across the embouchure hole, not down into it. The air
                stream and opening of the lips is smaller when playing piccolo.

                Proper practice time and techniques are critical for piccolo
                playing. Simply put, you get out what you put into your practice
                time. Many flutists recommend warming up on flute before
                practicing on piccolo and finishing the practice session on
                flute. It is important to set practice goals with your private
                teacher. Some teachers require a minimum number of practice
                minutes per day. Others will ask you to practice however long it
                takes to accomplish a specific practice goal. Use a practice log
                in order to establish a routine and to set goals that provide
                the best results for you.<br /><br />Divide your practice time
                between long-tones, scales, technical exercises, etudes, solo
                repertoire, orchestral excerpts and sight-reading exercises. It
                is important to spend the majority of your time on passages that
                you struggle with rather than playing the things that you do
                well over and over again. Decide what you would like to
                accomplish in the practice session before you begin and stick to
                it. Focus on smaller sections within the music and do “nitty
                gritty” detailed practice rather than playing through the music
                over and over again without making any progress. Once you have
                mastered the smaller sections of music, you can work on
                connecting the pieces and practice smooth transitions. Before
                you know it, the entire piece will be ready to perform. Ask your
                teacher for a variety of practice techniques to make your
                practice time as efficient as possible.<br /><br />It is
                important to practice in a quiet space that’s devoid of
                distractions in order to maintain focus. Try to avoid
                multitasking while playing your piccolo, such as texting,
                gaming, or practicing with the TV on. However, it is important
                to take a break about every 20-25 minutes to avoid injury and to
                clear your mind.

                Your piccolo is very fragile, so make sure you handle it with
                care. Avoid holding the instrument by the rods and touching the
                small screws and springs. It doesn’t take much to accidentally
                knock a piccolo out of alignment. If you experience any
                difficulties while playing the instrument, have your teacher
                look at it.

                Make sure your hands are clean before playing your piccolo.
                Never warm up a wooden piccolo by blowing into it. The
                instrument could crack. Instead, place it under your arm for a
                couple seconds so the instrument can easily acclimate to your
                body temperature and the temperature of the space you are in.
                Condensation build-up is a common occurrence on the piccolo. The
                instrument should be swabbed frequently during use and after
                every use in order to avoid watery keys, damaged pads and
                mildew, all of which could lead to expensive repairs. Keep your
                piccolo stored in its case in a safe place and avoid exposing
                the instrument to extreme temperatures and humidity changes.
                Even with constant swabbing, piccolos tend to collect water in
                the keys and pads. Moisture can be removed by placing a sheet of
                cleaning paper between the instrument and the key. Once the
                paper is in place, gently close and open the key. Pulling the
                paper while pressing a key can lead to torn pads, so please ask
                your teacher for assistance. Swab your instrument after every
                use and gently wipe any fingerprints off of the keys with a soft
                cleaning cloth.

                Piccolo vs Flute: What's the Difference?
              </h3>
            </div>
            <div>
              <p>
                Although the mechanism and fingerings are the same, the piccolo
                is quite different than the flute and it should be approached as
                a separate instrument. As the highest voice in the ensemble, the
                piccolo is often exposed, adding color to the texture and should
                be played with confidence. Once the flutist has a solid third
                register on the flute, they can consider pursuing the piccolo.
                The piccolo sounds an octave higher than the flute and acts as a
                fourth octave extension of the flute. The piccolo is much more
                sensitive than the flute and requires finger muscles control and
                more support. Even the smallest changes can lead to a great
                difference in sound quality and intonation. Practice with a
                tuner often to establish a strong pitch center and play duets
                with a friend to work on your intonation in a fun chamber music
                setting. The piccolo is placed a little higher on the bottom lip
                compared to the flute and the embouchure should be slightly
                firmer, but not tight or inflexible. The aperture should be
                smaller for piccolo playing, but be sure to keep the oral cavity
                open and relax and avoid pinching the lips.<br /><br />The
                piccolo should be played with finesse, not power and force. It
                requires less air than the flute, but the air stream should
                remain fast and focused. Articulation will be lighter on piccolo
                than flute and the low register should sound relaxed and full,
                allowing the sound to resonate in the mouth and chest of the
                player. The piccoloist can accomplish this by playing long-tones
                regularly with the goal of making each register sound rich and
                even. The fingers are closer together when playing piccolo, so
                technique might be a little easier than on flute. Scales and
                other technical exercises should be practiced on both the flute
                and piccolo to develop great flexibility and intonation. Both
                flute and piccolo should be practiced equally and it is
                important to vary your practice sessions to get used to
                switching back and forth between instruments often and easily.

              <p>
                When purchasing an instrument and asking what kind of piccolo
                you should buy, ask yourself what you plan to use it for and how
                much money do you want to spend. Metal piccolos have a headjoint
                with a lip plate like the flute, so that makes for an easier
                transition if you are new to the piccolo. These instruments are
                great for marching band because they are durable and have a very
                bright tone. Plastic piccolos are durable enough for use
                outdoors and can be used in a concert band setting. The tone
                quality is warmer than the tone of a metal piccolo and they are
                reasonably priced. Many instrument makers are now making
                piccolos out of plastic or composite materials. These piccolos
                are perfect for younger players who might need to use their
                instrument in both indoor and outdoor settings. The best quality
                piccolos are made out of wood, usually grenadilla, which gives
                the instrument a really warm sound. They are more expensive than
                metal and plastic piccolos, are best suited for indoor use and
                blend more easily with other woodwind instruments.

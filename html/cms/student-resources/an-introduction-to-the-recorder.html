                Recorders should be cleaned every time they are played.
                Otherwise, moisture build-up on the inside of the instrument can
                lead to mold and mildew! Many times, cleaning rods are included,
                but if you do not have one they are an inexpensive necessity.

                The soprano recorder is what most people think of when they hear
                "recorder." It’s the type of recorder used in elementary
                schools. However, please keep in mind that many music stores
                will carry several of the above instruments, so make sure you
                choose the correct one! If you are purchasing a recorder for
                elementary school, you will most likely be looking for a soprano
                recorder. There are also several different types of each
                recorder. Recorders can be made of wood (different types of wood
                give different sounds) or plastic. Wooden recorders are
                preferred by professional recorder players, while plastic
                recorders are certainly encouraged for the young beginner. Some
                recorders will come in one piece while others will come in two
                or three pieces.

                Although many people think of the recorder as the instrument
                they were introduced to music by in elementary school, the
                recorder has actually been around for centuries. In fact, it is
                one of the oldest known instruments still played today! Prior to
                the 1700's, most pieces written for flute were actually written
                for the recorder. The instrument most similar to today's flute
                was called the "traverso" or "transverse flute" because it was
                held horizontally as opposed to the vertical recorder.
                Technological advancements of the instrument over many years led
                to what we now know as the modern flute. The soprano and tenor
                recorder still use fingerings very similar to the flute. The
                sopranino, alto and bass recorders share the same fingerings
                that are most similar to our modern clarinet.

                Depending upon the type of recorder you own, your instrument may
                come in all one piece or it may be made up of three parts: the
                headjoint, body and foot. When connecting the pieces, the hole
                in the headjoint should line up in a straight line with the row
                of holes on the body. The hole in the foot joint should remain
                slightly out of line with the others in order to allow the pinky
                to comfortably cover it completely.<br /><br />To hold the
                recorder, make a "C" shape with both hands. Your left hand
                should be placed above the right hand, with the thumb on the
                hole in the back. Your fingers should wrap around and cover the

                Reading Music: Notes and Rhythm

            <div>
              <p>
                In order to play the recorder, you must be able to read music.
                Most music for recorders is written in treble clef, except for
                bass recorder which commonly uses bass clef. All notes are one
                of the letters of the music alphabet: A, B, C, D, E, F or G.
                These notes can also be sharp (#), which raises the pitch by a
                half step, or flat (b), which lowers the pitch by a half step.
                The rhythm tells us how long to hold a note. Use of flash cards
                and/or note and rhythm game apps or websites is encouraged. The
                sooner music notation is learned, the easier everything else
                will be!

                Fortunately, producing the first sound on the recorder comes
                fairly easily for most students! Take a good, deep breath
                through the mouth. Using your lips, form a seal around the
                opening of the recorder at the top. Keeping an open throat
                (think of yawning), blow the air through the recorder. Be
                careful not to blow too hard or you will produce a loud squeak!
              </p>
            </div>

              <p>
                Once you become comfortable producing a consistent sound, it’s
                important to begin "tonguing" as soon as possible. This refers
                to the use of a "too" sound to begin each note.

                Proper practice is essential for the success of any musician.
                20-30 minutes a day, five days a week is the minimum amount of
                practice required to maintain and progress on the recorder,
                although the more you practice the more you will improve! Check
                with your teacher for personalized practice time
                recommendations. Use of practice charts and logs is encouraged,
                especially for beginners.

                Most recorders are fairly sturdy instruments, so most care is
                common sense:
              </p>
              <ul class="arrow">
                <li>Do not swing the recorder around.</li>
                <li>Swab out your recorder every time you finish playing.</li>
                <li>
                  Keep the recorder stored safely and avoid extremes in
                  temperature and direct sunlight if you have a wooden
                  instrument.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Keep the recorder dry. Excess moisture can cause mold and
                  mildew.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If you own a plastic recorder, it can be cleaned with water,
                  but if your recorder has any wooden parts or has any pads,
                  please avoid water!
                </li>
                <li>
                  If your recorder comes in several pieces, you may need to
                  grease the joints occasionally to ensure proper assembly. To
                  do this, use a soft cloth to wipe away any old grease. Then,
                  using your finger, apply a small amount around the joint. Only
                  a little is required! Wipe away any excess after assembly. And
                  of course, don't forget to wash your hands after applying! If
                  your recorder is all one piece, no grease is necessary.

                Good reeds are important in successfully creating a good sound
                on the saxophone. Beginners typically start on a size 2 reed and
                increase strength (2.5, 3, 3.5, etc.) as they develop a level of
                comfort and proficiency. Beginners will go through reeds rather
                quickly because they are extremely delicate. As students learn
                how to properly place them on the mouthpiece and care for them,
                they’ll begin to last a little longer.

                Reed cases are necessary for maximizing the lifespan of your
                reeds. They protect reeds from becoming damaged and warped, and
                they allow students to easily store reeds away after use.
                Students should have at least four working reeds in their case
                at all times, so a case that holds multiple reeds is ideal.

                The neck strap attaches to the body of the saxophone using a
                hook and is worn around the neck to help support the saxophone.
                Better neck straps are padded, hence more comfortable, and often
                will include hooks that close completely to offer more security.

                A swab is essential in the care and maintenance of the
                instrument. It removes the moisture from the pads and instrument
                after each practice session. Excess moisture left on the pads
                after practice will wear away at the pads, quickly causing them
                not to seal or to possibly fall off. This will cause the
                instrument to not respond properly, or at all.

                This comes in a small tube that looks like chapstick. A small
                amount is placed on the neck cork of the saxophone when putting
                it together. Cork grease helps the mouthpiece connect to the
                neck easily and avoids tearing the cork or damaging the
                instrument. New corks should be greased each time the saxophone
                is put together. Once the mouthpiece can go on smoothly, the
                student should only need to grease the cork once a week.

                A tuner helps the student learn how to play in tune. By playing
                with the tuner, saxophone students can learn how to adjust their
                mouth in order to play each note in tune. It also trains their
                ear and teaches them how to hear and match pitches. This is
                especially important for practicing at home. Playing at school
                trains a student’s ear simply by playing with other instruments.

              <h4>The Reed, Ligature and Mouthpiece</h4>

            <div>
              <p>
                The reed is a small piece of cane placed on the mouthpiece. It
                is the wood part of this woodwind instrument, and it’s necessary
                for producing sounds on the saxophone. It is important that the
                student wet the reed gently in their mouth for approximately for
                one minute prior to placing it on the mouthpiece. This makes the
                reed softer and more flexible, allowing it to vibrate and
                respond. The reed will not play correctly––or at all––if it is
                chipped or broken.<br /><br />The flat part of the reed lies
                against the flat part of the mouthpiece. It does not go inside
                the mouthpiece. It is held onto the mouthpiece by the ligature.
                The student must be very careful when placing the ligature on
                the mouthpiece as to not chip the reed. Some ligatures tighten
                around the mouthpiece with the screws on the reed side and
                others with the screws on the back of the mouthpiece. The screws
                should always be on the right side of the mouthpiece and should
                be easily tightened with the right hand. The mouthpiece cap goes
                over the whole setup when not playing to protect the reed and
                the mouthpiece.
              </p>

            <div class="umb-text--normal">
              <h4>The Neck</h4>
            </div>
            <div>
              <p>
                The mouthpiece should be placed on the neck, after greasing the
                cork, by slowly twisting it back and forth. The flat part of the
                mouthpiece should be facing the ground or underside of the neck.
                The octave key runs along the top of the neck. The student
                should be careful not to place too much pressure on this key
                when putting the mouthpiece on the neck. After the mouthpiece
                has been placed on the neck, the student can then carefully
                insert the neck into the body of the saxophone and tighten the
                neck screw once it is properly lined up. The neck screw should
                always be loosened when inserting and removing the neck and
                tightened when the neck is in place to keep it from spinning
                around in the body. If the student is struggling to get the neck
                to go into the body, they may use a small amount of cork grease
                on the tenon as well to get the neck to insert smoothly in the
                body.

                The saxophone is played with the left hand on top and the right

                corresponds with each finger as well as the thumb of the left
                hand. The right hand thumb is placed UNDER the thumb rest and is

                As the player progresses through their musical studies, they’ll
                improve their ability to read, write, and understand written
                music. As with any language, there are several components that,
                once learned, will provide the player with the ability to
                fluidly connect musical passages and the ability to compose and
                arrange their own music.

                Every note written on a piece of music corresponds with a
                fingering on the saxophone. The notes on the staff will tell you
                which notes to play and consequently which fingers to use. In
                beginner books, the fingering is often written out for the
                student each time a new note is introduced. They also often
                include a fingering chart in the book, normally on the first or
                last page. Each darkened circle represents a key that is to be
                pushed down. Sometimes this is done with a finger or your palm.
                Sometimes both! These charts can also be purchased separately to
                keep on the stand as a reference. They will look something like
                this:

                Each note will be a certain shape. Some will be colored in and
                others will empty. Some will have beams connecting them and
                others have a single stem. These differences in shapes, beams
                and stems dictate how long each note should be held for. Here is
                a basic chart explaining the length of notes:

            <div>
              <p>
                The time signature tells you how many beats are in each measure.
                It also tells you what type of note will receive the value of
                one beat. In most cases, the quarter note will receive one down
                beat. If you were to tap your foot or put the metronome on, each
                tap or click would be equivalent to one quarter note in many
                cases. The top number of the time signature tells you how many
                beats are in each measure you are playing. The chart below is a
                brief summary of some of the most common time signatures the
                student will see:

              <h4>The Key Signature:</h4>
            </div>
            <div>
              <p>
                The key signature tells you which notes are changed to flats or
                sharps throughout the piece. There is a fingering that
                corresponds with each note that is sharpened or flattened. To
                sharpen a note, you raise the pitch of that note by half a step
                by altering the fingering. To flatten a note, you lower the
                pitch by half a step also by altering the fingering. A key
                signature can have anywhere from zero to seven flats or zero to
                seven sharps. You will never see flats AND sharps together in a
                key signature. It will only be one or the other. However, you
                could see one in the key signature and individual notes altered
                to the other within the music. These are called accidentals.
                Below is an example of what key signatures look like:

            </div>
            <div>
              <p>
                Each sharp or flat is on a line or space on the staff and that
                tells you which note is sharp or flat within the piece.

                For most beginning saxophone students, a reasonable amount of
                practice time is approximately 15-20 minutes per day. Often,
                their mouths cannot play for much longer than that as they are
                developing muscles around their mouths necessary for playing.
                They can slowly extend their practice time to 30 minutes as
                their endurance increases. An intermediate player should be
                practicing 30 minutes a day and an advanced player 45 minutes to
                an hour.

                Proper practice technique is key to successful practice and the
                mastery of music. Always sit down with a specific goal in mind
                rather than practicing aimlessly and without direction. Think of
                it like a workout. You need a warm-up, strength training, cardio
                and a stretch. Decide what you’d like to accomplish before you
                begin the session and work toward that goal. All practice
                sessions should be broken in to focused sections or exercises.
                Long-tones or warm-ups stretch out the lungs and muscles around
                your mouth. This is called the embouchure. Technical exercises
                get the fingers moving and reinforce music reading skills.
                Breaking the piece into smaller sections, isolating problem
                measures and slowing down difficult passages will always result
                in a successful practice session. The piece or passage will come
                together very quickly if you do these things!

              <p>
                Always use a music stand and supportive chair when practicing.
                This will ensure proper hand and body position as well as proper
                air support. It makes playing the instrument easy and eliminates
                unnecessary challenges. Sit up straight with both feet on the
                floor and bring the saxophone to you, ensuring the mouthpiece is
                coming straight into your mouth. Never lean down to go to the
                saxophone, rather bring the saxophone straight to you. Make sure
                you are taking in an adequate amount of mouthpiece so that you
                are resonating correctly and filling the entire saxophone up
                with air, promoting the best quality sound. Embouchure (the way
                the mouth is sealed around the mouthpiece) should be firm with
                no puffing cheeks or air leaking from the corners. Fingers
                should be relaxed and curved, as if you were holding a can of
                soda. Make sure you are in a quiet location where you can listen
                to your sound, work with your tuner and not get distracted from
                your goals.

                The saxophone should be swabbed out after every playing session.
                Depending on the length of practice, pulling the swab through
                about five times should be adequate. Also, the cork should be
                greased about once a week. Always remove the reed from the
                mouthpiece when finished playing and place it in a reed case to
                prevent warping and chipping. Never force the case closed or put
                anything on top of the saxophone inside the case. This avoids
                unintentionally damaging mechanisms on the instrument. Always
                remove the neck strap before placing the saxophone back in the
                case to prevent scratching the instrument. Make sure all the
                parts are placed back neatly and correctly in the case before
                closing.

              <h4>Once a Year Tune Up</h4>

            <div>
              <p>
                You should send your saxophone in once a year for a “tune-up” to
                a certified technician, even if you don’t think anything is
                wrong. There are many moving parts and tiny pieces on a
                saxophone that need routine checking over, just like a car. Pads
                are replaced when they are start to tear or are no longer seal
                correctly. This can make a world of difference in the way your
                saxophone responds. Springs, the needle-like pins that open and
                close the keys, can rust out, break off or lose tension, causing
                the key not to lift or close. The mechanisms also need to be
                regulated, which means all the keys might not be closing
                correctly. These and many other factors are normal wear on an
                instrument, and slowly but progressively make it difficult to
                play. A quality instrument that is properly maintenance will
                stand the test of time.

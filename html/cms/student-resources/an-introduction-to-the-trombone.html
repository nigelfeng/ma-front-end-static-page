                Nothing substitutes for a music stand. A student shouldn’t
                practice with music placed on a piano, the trombone case, the
                bed or anywhere else. Proper playing posture cannot be achieved
                if the music is not positioned directly in front of the student
                at eye level or slightly below eye level.

              <p>
                This is not in the starter pack. A metronome is an electronic
                device that produces steady clicks to help the student count
                notes and to keep a consistent rhythm. Trombone students should
                purchase metronomes loud enough to be heard over the sound of
                their instrument.

              <p>
                Most beginning band books now come with audio CD’s or MP3
                downloads, so a CD player or MP3 player is helpful in the room
                where the student will practice. This can be a stereo system,
                smartphone, tablet or an inexpensive boombox. A portable player
                with earbuds is NOT acceptable because the student cannot hear
                the true sound of the trombone at the same time as the audio
                guide tracks.

              <p>
                The main trombone slide MUST be oiled every day before the
                trombone is played. This involves removing the slide and
                applying oil or cream to the inner slide tubing. “Spit” or water
                should be let out before putting the trombone back in its case.
                Fingerprints should be wiped off the exterior before putting the
                trombone away.
              </p>
              <h4 role="heading" aria-level="3">Weekly Maintenance</h4>
              <p>
                For weekly trombone maintenance, the main slide must be removed
                and the interior slide tubing is cleaned with a swab or cloth.
                The mouthpiece is cleaned inside using the small thin brush
                found in the Starter Pack with running water. Soap is NOT needed
                or recommend.
              </p>
              <h4 role="heading" aria-level="3">Monthly Maintenance</h4>
              <p>
                The main slide and tuning slides are removed, wiped clean with a
                paper towel and fresh slide cream and oil or grease is applied
                to all the sliding surfaces. After reinserting the slides, wipe
                away all excess grease.
              </p>
              <p>
                The main slide lead pipe (the tube into with the mouthpiece is
                inserted) is cleaned inside using the “snake” brush found in the
                Starter Pack with running water. Soap is NOT needed or
                recommended.
              </p>
              <h4 role="heading" aria-level="3">3 Times per year cleaning</h4>
              <p>
                A full interior cleaning is needed periodically. My usual
                recommended schedule for students is Winter Break, Spring Break
                and Summer. While most students are comfortable performing a
                full cleaning at home, a full cleaning service is also offered
                (for a fee) by the Music &amp; Arts repair facility.

            <div>
              <p>
                When a student comes for lessons, one almost universal goal is
                to move them to (or stay at) the top of the class or near the
                top of the class. My practice guidelines are based on the amount
                of practice that I feel is necessary to achieve that goal.
              </p>
              <h4 role="heading" aria-level="3">Scheduling the right amount</h4>
              <p>
                My recommended daily practice minutes are measured by a
                student’s grade level multiplied by four. So, if the student is
                in 6th grade, their minimum practice should be 24 minutes daily.
                In 9th grade, it should be 36 minutes.
              </p>
              <p>
                My guidelines assume six days of practice and one day off each
                week. So, calculating WEEKLY practice needs for 6th grade, we
                get 144 minutes calculated this way: 6 x 4 = 24 minutes daily,
                24 minutes x 6 days = 144 minutes weekly.
              </p>
              <p>
                If the student’s schedule allows fewer than six days of practice
                per week, then the DAILY amount needs to be recalculated to
                achieve the same WEEKLY total. For example, 144 minutes divided
                over five days means 29 minutes each practice session. 144
                minutes divided over four days means 36 minutes each practice
                session and 144 minutes divided over three days means 48 minutes
                each practice session.
              </p>
              <h4 role="heading" aria-level="3">
                Measuring the practice amount
              </h4>
              <p>
                Here’s where things can go wrong. 24 minutes of practice does
                NOT mean sitting at the music stand for 24 minutes with five
                minutes spent oiling the slide, five minutes spent counting
                notes and five minutes of resting between songs because “my lips
                hurt.”
              </p>
              <p>
                24 minutes of practice means 24 minutes of sound coming from the
                trombone––no matter how long it takes to get there. A focused
                student can do 24 minutes of practicing in 25 or 26 minutes. An
                unfocused student may stretch those 24 minutes into an hour.
              </p>
              <p>
                For the first few weeks, dividing the practice into two sessions
                may be desirable so long as it doesn’t become an excuse to cut
                practice time by half by never getting around to the second
                session. If the practice is divided, I prefer that the first
                session be about 2/3 to 3/4 of the total daily practice.

                The cheeks must NOT puff out when playing. If the student claims
                they cannot play any other way, quickly seek the advice of a
                professional teacher. Do not let them continue this way.

                One common bad habit is placing the left elbow in the side to
                support the instrument. Elbows must stay two to eight inches
                away from the body, preferably both elbows the same distance
                out. A younger student will want the elbows lower than an older
                student, which is acceptable, but they must not touch the side
                of the body.

                Poor posture can be in the form of leaning back in a chair or
                leaning to one side or leaning forward with the elbows on the
                knees. My personal recommendation is that the student sits on an
                exercise ball while practicing because this automatically
                promotes excellent posture, while also strengthening the core
                (abdominal) muscles that are important to playing trombone as
                well.

                Spit accumulates in the curve of the main slide. This is
                natural, so there is a “spit valve,” euphemistically called a
                “water key” in most instruction books. The spit normally needs
                to be emptied several items during each practice session.
                Trombone players need to keep a section of yesterday’s
                newspaper, towel or a carpet scrap under the music stand for
                this purpose.

                This happens occasionally from bumping the mouthpiece or
                dropping the trombone. Music &amp; Arts has a special tool that
                will remove stuck mouthpieces without damaging the trombone or
                the mouthpiece. There is no charge for this in-store service. If
                you try to do this yourself, you’ll likely damage both the
                instrument and the mouthpiece.

                Yes, it is possible to play with braces. About 25% of students
                are able to play with little or no difficulty. Another 25% find
                it’s a convenient excuse to quit playing. The remaining 50% can
                play with the help of either dental was or a wonderful product
                called Brace Guard (available at Music &amp; Arts.) There is
                usually an adjustment period which may be painful for a few
                weeks, but Brace Guard can dramatically shorten the adjustment
                period.

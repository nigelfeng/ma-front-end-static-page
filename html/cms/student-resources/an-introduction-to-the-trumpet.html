                bed or anywhere else. Proper playing posture cannot be achieved
                if the music is not positioned directly in front of the student

                This is not in the Starter Pack. It’s an electronic device which
                produces steady clicks to help the student count the proper note
                length and keep a consistent rhythm. For trumpet, get the
                loudest metronome you can find.

                Most beginning band books now come with audio CDs, so a CD
                player is helpful in the room where the student will practice.
                This can be a stereo system or an inexpensive boombox. A
                portable player with earbuds is NOT acceptable because the
                student cannot hear the true sound of the trumpet at the same
                time as the audio guide tracks.

                Valves MUST be oiled every day before the trumpet is played.
                This involves removing each valve to apply oil to all surfaces.
                Spit should be let out before putting the trumpet back in its
                case. Fingerprints should be wiped off the exterior before
                putting trumpet away.

                cleaned inside using the small thin brush found in the Starter
                Pack with running water. Soap is NOT needed or recommended.

                A full interior cleaning is needed periodically. My usual

                and Summer. While most students are comfortable performing a
                full cleaning at home, a full cleaning service is also offered
                (for a fee) by the Music &amp; Arts repair facility.

                When a student comes for lessons, an almost universal goal is to
                move to (or stay at) the top of the class, or near the top of
                the class. My practice guidelines are based on the amount that I
                feel is necessary to achieve that goal.

              <p>
                Daily practice minutes are found by multiplying a student’s
                grade level by four. So, if the student is in 6th grade, minimum
                practice should be 24 minutes daily. In 9th grade, it should be
                36 minutes.
              </p>
              <p>
                My guidelines assume 6 days of practice and one day off each
                week. So, calculating WEEKLY practice needs for sixth grade, we
                get 144 minutes, calculated this way: 6 x 4 = 24 min daily, 24
                minutes x 6 days = 144 minutes weekly.
              </p>
              <p>
                If the student’s schedule allows fewer than six days days of
                practice per week, then the DAILY amount needs to be
                recalculated to achieve the same WEEKLY total. Example:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  144 minutes divided over 5 days means 29 minutes each practice
                  session.
                </li>
                <li>
                  144 minutes divided over 4 days means 36 minutes each practice
                  session.
                </li>
                <li>
                  144 minutes divided over 3 days means 48 minutes each practice
                  session.

                      Here’s where things can go wrong. 24 minutes of practice
                      does NOT mean sitting at the music stand for 24 minutes
                      with five minutes spent oiling valves, five minutes spent
                      counting notes, and five minutes of resting between songs
                      because “my lips hurt.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      24 minutes of practice means 24 minutes of sound coming
                      from the trumpet, no matter how long it takes to get
                      there. A focused student can do 24 minutes of practicing
                      in 25 or 26 minutes. An unfocused student may stretch
                      those 24 minutes into an hour.

                    <p>
                      For the first few weeks, dividing the practice into two
                      sessions may be desirable as long as it doesn’t become an
                      excuse to cut practice time by half by never getting
                      around to the second session. If practice is divided, I
                      prefer that the first session be about 2/3 to 3/4 of the
                      total daily practice.

                The cheeks must NOT puff out when playing. If the student claims
                he cannot play any other way, quickly seek the advice of a
                professional teacher. Do not let him or her continue this way.

              <p>
                One common bad habit is placing the left elbow in the side to
                support the instrument. Elbows must stay two to eight inches
                away from the body, preferably both elbows the same distance
                out. Younger students will want the elbows lower than older
                students, which is acceptable, but they must not touch the side
                of the body.

              <p>
                Poor posture can be in the form of leaning back in a chair,
                leaning to one side or leaning forward with the elbows on the
                knees. My personal recommendation is that the student sit on an
                exercise ball while practicing because this automatically
                promotes excellent posture while strengthening the core
                (abdominal) muscles that are important to playing trumpet well.

                This usually causes panic the first time it happens. The most

              <ol>
                <li>
                  The valves were replaced in the wrong order. Check the numbers
                  that are printed on all three valves to be sure they’re in the
                  right place.
                </li>
                <li>
                  One valve (or more) is not “locked in” to the proper position.
                  Grab each valve cap (the place where the fingers rest) and
                  gently turn in a clockwise direction until the valve clicks.
                  It’s now locked in place and the trumpet should play.

                Spit accumulates in the first curve of the trumpet (the tuning
                slide.) This is natural, so there is a “spit valve,” which is
                euphemistically called a “water key” in most instruction books.
                The spit normally needs to be emptied several times during each
                practice session. Trumpet players need to keep a section of
                yesterday’s newspaper, towel or a carpet scrap under the music
                stand for this purpose.

                This happens occasionally from bumping the mouthpiece or
                dropping the trumpet. Music &amp; Arts has a special tool that
                will remove stuck mouthpieces without damaging the trumpet or
                the mouthpiece. There is no charge for this in-store service. If
                you try to do this yourself, you’ll likely damage both the
                instrument and the mouthpiece.

                Yes, it is possible to play with braces. About 25% of students
                are able to play with little or no difficulty. Another 25% find
                it’s a convenient excuse to quit playing. The remaining 50% can
                play with the help of either dental wax or a wonderful product
                called Brace Guard that’s available at Music &amp; Arts. There
                is usually an adjustment period, which may be painful for a few
                weeks, but Brace Guard can dramatically shorten the adjustment
                period.

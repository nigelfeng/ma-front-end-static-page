                Quality strings are one of the most important factors impacting
                a ukulele’s tone and playability. Professional players typically
                change their strings every three months or so, while beginning
                to intermediate players should change theirs about every six
                months. In addition to improving the sound and feel, changing
                your strings also provides for a great opportunity to clean your
                ukulele to keep it looking new.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you’ve been playing on old strings for a while, you’ve likely
                forgotten how much better new strings sound to your ears and how
                they feel on your fingers, so here are a few tips to recognize
                that it’s time to change your strings:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  One or more strings are discolored and are no longer shiny
                </li>
                <li>
                  Dents have formed where your strings have repeatedly made
                  contact with the frets
                </li>
                <li>
                  A string breaks seemingly for no reason or you notice one or
                  more strings beginning to fray
                </li>
                <li>Your instrument is no longer holding its tune</li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                Ask your teacher or sales associate for tips on which strings to
                buy and how/where to put on your new strings.

                Tuners help keep your instrument in tune and sounding great.
                Tuning should be performed prior to every playing session, so
                tuners are an essential tool for every student. When it comes to
                purchasing the right tuner, there a lot of great options for
                string players, including handheld and clip-on tuners. I highly
                recommend clip-on tuners for uke players because they are small
                and work well in noisy environments because they use the
                vibrations of your instrument rather than the sound to tune.

              <p>
                Metronomes provide a steady beat that helps musicians develop
                their sense of rhythm in addition to helping players build up
                their speed by allowing them to work on a passage slowly and to
                steadily increase the tempo until their desired speed is
                achieved. Over the years, metronomes have come a long way. More
                than the bulky pendular devices that may come to mind when you
                think of this tool, there are now a lot of great compact digital
                options to choose from that do much more than their wooden
                predecessors, including ones that provide complex beat patterns
                and headphone jacks. Regardless of which type is best for you,
                metronomes are one of the most important practice partners
                you’ll ever have because rhythm is the one of the most
                fundamental aspects of music. Without a good sense of rhythm,
                you won’t be able to play well with others or perform your own
                music accurately, so make your metronome your friend.

                Although some players prefer to strum and pluck with their

                Picks help ensure consistency of tone, protect your fingers from
                injury and help you play faster and louder. Please note that it
                is important not to play with picks intended for other
                instruments as they may damage your strings.

                Using an instrument stand helps keep your ukulele safe and
                easily accessible when you’re not using it. They are a great
                place to set your instrument down briefly during play or to
                leave it overnight between practice sessions. Although they do
                not protect your instrument as well as a hard case, I recommend
                using them whenever possible because of the out of sight out of
                mind phenomenon. If your instrument is locked away inside a case
                in a closet, you are less likely to pick it up and play it, yet
                if it’s visible throughout the day, you are more likely to
                remember to practice and to make regular play a part of your
                daily routine.

                Instrument cases are essential for safe transport of your
                ukulele from your home to your lesson studio or to a gig. Prior
                to purchasing a case, it is necessary to ensure that you are
                buying one that fits your instrument and your needs. This will
                likely come down to a choice between a hard or soft case. Both
                types of cases make your instrument easier to transport and may
                also provide pockets in which to place your sheet music. Soft
                cases are the cheapest and lightest to carry, but do not protect
                your instrument as well as hard cases. And while hard cases are
                heavier and more expensive, they can withstand the inevitable
                bumps and falls that will impact your instrument. In dry
                climates, hard cases also provide a more sealed environment to
                keep your instrument hydrated. Ask your teacher or sales
                associate for suggestions on which type of case is best for your
                instrument and your needs.

                The ukulele is a small guitar-like instrument with Portuguese
                and Hawaiian origins. Although it has been around for over 100
                years, the ukulele has enjoyed a recent resurgence in popularity
                with groups like Train and Twenty One Pilots and artists like
                Eddie Vedder, Israel Kamakawiwo'ole and Jake Shimabukuro who are
                getting a new generation of musicians excited about this great
                instrument.

                Head. The remaining parts include the Bridge, the Soundhole,

                There are four different sizes of ukuleles ranging from Soprano
                to Baritone. The Soprano, Concert and Tenor ukuleles are all in
                what is called standard tuning, with the notes C, G, E, A.
                Baritones are tuned the same as the first four strings of a
                guitar, with the notes D, G, B, E.

                In order to be a good musician, it is important to be fluent in
                the language of music. This includes having an ability to read
                music and understand basic music theory. The following are four
                major components of written music that students must become
                familiar with in order to develop their musicality:
              </p>

                <strong>Notation:</strong> Ukulele music is written in the
                treble clef using standard notation and also in a tablature
                system that uses numbers to represent frets. In standard
                notation, the notes on the staff will tell you which notes to
                play on your ukulele. In beginning method books, the fingering
                is shown each time a new note is introduced. For tablature, the
                horizontal lines represent the strings and the numbers are frets
                as shown below in the example below:

                <strong>Rhythm: </strong>To convey rhythm, different shapes and

                <strong>Time Signature:</strong> The top number in a time
                signature tells you how many beats are in each measure and the
                bottom number tells you what type of note will receive the value
                of one beat. The chart below is a brief summary of some of the
                most common time signatures you will encounter:

                <strong>Key Signature:</strong> The key signature tells you
                which notes are changed to flats or sharps throughout a piece of
                music. Sharps look like italicized number signs and flats look
                like lowercase b’s. To sharpen a note, you raise the pitch of
                that note by playing it one half-step (one fret) higher. To
                flatten a note, you lower the pitch by playing it one half-step
                lower. A key signature can have anywhere from zero to seven
                flats or zero to seven sharps. Sharps always build in the
                following order, known as the Circle of Fifths: F, C, G, D, A,
                E, B. Flats move in the opposite order, which means that you
                will never see a key signature with only a D sharp because it
                would also have to also include F, C and G sharps. This would
                make the key of E in the chart below:

              <h3>Good Practice Habits</h3>

                <h4>Play Smart</h4>
                <p>
                  Good practice habits are essential to the mastery of your
                  instrument. Find a quiet room to play in––perhaps an office,
                  bedroom or empty living room. If possible, use a music stand
                  and an height-adjustable armless chair when practicing. If you
                  cannot adjust the height of your chair, you may want to prop
                  your leg up on a footstool. Once seated, sit with good posture
                  and try not to hold tension anywhere in your body that isn’t
                  necessary. This means that your shoulders should not be tense
                  and that your fingers should be relaxed when not in use.

                  Many players find it helpful to have a specific goal or goals
                  in mind prior to beginning their practice session. I always
                  recommend starting your routine with warm-up exercises. These
                  exercises get the blood flowing so that you can play your
                  best. They also provide you with an opportunity to focus
                  solely on proper technique. After you’re all warmed up, you
                  may want to start playing the studies and pieces recommended
                  by your instructor in your method book.

                  While playing new material, you are bound to encounter
                  difficulties and things you can’t play very well yet. When
                  this happens, don’t just fumble through it and move on, but
                  instead capitalize on the opportunity for improvement. As
                  author Denis Waitley says, “Failure should be our teacher, not
                  our undertaker. Failure is delay, not defeat”. With this in
                  mind, I suggest working on these difficult areas slowly and
                  not moving on until you have performed them correctly five
                  times in a row. This creates what many players call a good
                  muscle memory and dramatically increases your likelihood of
                  playing the section correctly the next time you play it. After
                  you’ve finished all your homework, you may want to end your
                  practice session by doing something fun like improvising,
                  composing or playing some of your favorite music.

                <h4>Play Often</h4>
                <p>
                  Your ukulele should not be collecting dust all week until it
                  is time for your lesson. For most beginning ukulele students,
                  a reasonable amount of practice time is approximately 15-20
                  minutes per day. Consistent practice is very important and in
                  fact, it is better to practice your instrument for 15-20
                  minutes most days of the week than once a week for two hours.
                  Also, new players must first develop calluses on their
                  fingertips and strength in their fingers before they’ll be
                  able to play for longer periods of time. Intermediate players
                  often practice anywhere 30 minutes a day or more and advanced
                  players may play for several hours a day.

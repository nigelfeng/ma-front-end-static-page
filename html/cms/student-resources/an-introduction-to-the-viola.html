                This tool is designed to help students play at a steady tempo
                and in the proper rhythm. Rhythmic development is key in the
                growth of every musician, so playing your viola with a metronome
                during every practice is recommended.

              </h4>
              <p>
                A music stand is required for proper posture. If the music is
                not placed at the appropriate height for the student
                (approximately eye level), this will have a negative impact on
                their posture. Bad posture also has a negative impact on the
                student's sound.
              </p>
              <h4>Notebook</h4>
              <p>
                A notebook is a great tool for success. In a notebook, the
                student (or their teacher) can make notes about new terms, what
                should be practiced and what goals should be made.
              </p>
              <h4>Pencils</h4>
              <p>
                Pencils are useful to write in both the student’s notebook and
                also in their sheet music. It can be useful for the student to
                mark fingerings and dynamics in their music. It is best to make
                these notes in pencil in case they need to be changed later.

              <p>
                A polishing cloth is a soft cloth for wiping rosin dust off of
                the viola. When rosin dust builds up on the viola, it dampens
                the sound and the instrument will not sound as good. Too much
                excess rosin dust can also cause the viola to become sticky to
                the touch and could cause damage to the varnish.

              </h4>
              <p>
                Rosin needs to be put on the bow hair before each playing
                session. There are two basic types of rosin: light (also known
                as amber) rosin, and dark rosin. If you reside in a humid area,
                you’ll want to use light rosin. If you live in a dry or arid
                climate, you should choose the dark rosin. If the area you live
                in has a large change in humidity during the year (such as the
                midwest), and you only want to purchase one rosin, you should
                choose the light rosin.

                This is a tool used to aid in posture and the hold of the viola.
                While some younger students (five years and under) sometimes do
                not need one, most older students find them necessary. Shoulder
                rests come in many forms, from a simple foam pad to a framework
                with solid padding, and are sized to your instrument.

                This is an electronic device that can help students make sure
                their viola is in tune before they start practicing. If the
                viola is not in tune, the student can be playing perfectly but
                it won’t matter.

            <div>
              <h4>Pegs</h4>
              <p>
                Pegs are the four black knobs at the top of the viola. They are
                used for making large pitch changes when tuning.
              </p>
              <h4>Fingerboard</h4>
              <p>
                The fingerboard is the long black piece underneath the strings.
                Keeping the bow off of the fingerboard will help produce a clear
                sound.
              </p>
              <h4>Strings</h4>
              <p>
                The viola has four strings. In descending order, they are: A, D,
                G, C. The A is the thinnest and highest-sounding of the strings,
                and the C is the thickest and lowest.

              <h4>F-holes</h4>
              <p>
                The two holes on the face of the viola are called the f-holes.
                It is a good idea to keep the f-holes uncovered while playing,
                as covering them will muffle the sound.
              </p>
              <h4>Bridge</h4>
              <p>
                The bridge is the piece of wood that holds the strings up and is
                located between the f-holes. The bridge's feet should be resting
                flat in order to avoid the bridge accidentally falling over.
              </p>
              <h4>Chin Rest</h4>
              <p>
                The chin rest is an oval piece of wood or plastic, typically
                black in color, located to the left of the tailpiece. This is
                where the player's chin/jaw rests. If your instrument does not
                have this piece or if it comes off, you should get it repaired
                immediately because it is not possible to hold the instrument
                properly without it.
              </p>
              <h4>Tailpiece</h4>
              <p>
                The tailpiece is located just underneath the bridge. All four
                strings and fine tuners are attached to the tailpiece.
              </p>
              <h4>Fine Tuners</h4>
              <p>
                Fine tuners are the little screws located on the tailpiece. The
                fine tuners are used for making small adjustments in pitch.
                There is no risk of breaking a string when tuning with fine
                tuners, so it is okay to use even without any training.
              </p>
              <h4>Sound Post</h4>
              <p>
                The small wooden rod located on the inside of the viola is
                called the soundpost. The soundpost helps to amplify sound and
                it also adds to the structural stability of the viola. It can be
                seen by looking through the f-holes.

              <h3>About Your Bow</h3>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4>Stick</h4>
              <p>
                The stick is the long wooden part of the bow. It is important to
                never tighten it too much. The stick should always curve under
                slightly (known as a recurve). If the stick is straight or bowed
                over it will become irreparably damaged.
              </p>
              <h4>Hair</h4>
              <p>
                The bow hair, usually made with horsehair, is parallel to the
                stick. The student must rosin the bow whenever the instrument is
                taken out and played. If the bow goes long enough without being
                rosined, it will be difficult to make a sound on the viola.
              </p>
              <h4>Frog</h4>
              <p>
                The frog is the heavy part on the end of the bow. This is where
                the player holds the bow.
              </p>
              <h4>Screw</h4>
              <p>
                The screw is found at the end of the frog, opposite of the hair.
                To tighten the bow, the screw must be turned to the right. To
                loosen the bow, the screw must be turned to the left.

              <p>
                It is important to practice the correct amount. Too little will
                result in slow progress, but too much can cause frustration
                and/or injury. Treating playing the viola like playing a sport
                can be very successful approach. Start practicing a small amount
                each day and slowly increase the practice amount as the student
                gains skill.
              </p>
              <p>
                A frequent question from parents is, “How much should my child
                be practicing each day?” Using the lesson length is a good place
                to start. If the student has a 30 minute lesson, it would be
                appropriate for them to be practicing around 30 minutes a day.
                Some students have difficulty focusing for a whole 30 minutes,
                especially younger ones. If that is the case, instead of doing
                timed practices, students should practice each assigned piece
                five times each day. This gives them a clear stopping point
                while ensuring they practice everything their teacher assigned.

                  Sudden and extreme changes in temperature are bad for your
                  instrument. While your case helps slow down these changes, you
                  should do your best to avoid exposing your instrument to
                  excessive heat, cold, humidity, or dryness. Large changes in
                  temperature put your instrument at risk for cracking,
                  separated seams, broken joints, and broken strings.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Cold – While it is best to avoid doing so, you can still take
                  your instrument into a snowstorm if absolutely necessary. Just
                  make sure to keep it in a properly insulated case and to take
                  it back inside as soon as possible.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Damp – Never expose your viola to excess humidity. Too much
                  moisture will cause the wood to warp and the glue to break
                  down. A well-insulated case should protect the instrument, but
                  if you are going out into the rain or snow, consider covering
                  your case with a garbage bag for extra protection.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Heat – Too much heat can severely damage the joints and seams
                  of your viola. Extreme heat can also melt the glue that holds
                  your instrument together. Never leave your instrument in a hot
                  car or store it in direct sunlight.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Dry – Wood needs some moisture to keep its shape, otherwise it
                  can become brittle and crack. If you live in or are visiting
                  an area that is extremely dry, you should invest in an
                  instrument humidifier to protect your viola.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Earthquake/tornado – If you live in an area that is prone to
                  earthquakes or tornadoes, do not store your instrument near a
                  piece of furniture that might fall (ex: bookcases). A heavy
                  object falling on your viola, even while it is in the case,
                  can cause severe damage to your instrument.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h4>Do's and Don'ts</h4>
              <ul class="arrow">
                <li>
                  It is easy to break a string accidentally when tuning with the
                  pegs. Therefore, it is recommended that the student/parent not
                  use the pegs until they receive specific instruction from
                  their teacher.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It is recommended that student violists change their strings
                  at least once a year to ensure they get the best sound. To
                  make it easy to remember when to change the strings, pick a
                  memorable date for your annual strings change (birthday,
                  Christmas, Independence Day, etc).
                </li>
                <li>
                  If your soundpost should fall, immediately loosen all the
                  strings and take it to the repair shop. Never play on a viola
                  without a soundpost. Doing so can cause irreparable damage to
                  the instrument.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Never touch the bow hair. The oils on our skin will make the
                  hair dirty. When the bow hair is dirty, it will not make as
                  much sound no matter how much rosin is applied.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Never leave your viola alone in the car. The change of
                  temperature in an unattended car can cause irreparable damage
                  to your instrument. Too much heat can cause the varnish to
                  bubble and glue to unstick, while too much cold can cause the
                  instrument to crack. Also, unattended instruments are often
                  targets for theft.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Keep your viola in the case when it is not in use. Do not
                  leave it on the floor or a chair, as it could accidentally be
                  stepped or sat on.
                </li>

              <h3>Forming Good Habits, Not Bad Habits</h3>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4>Practicing</h4>
              <p>
                Practicing is something that needs to happen every day. Many
                people find it helpful to integrate practicing into their daily
                routine. Others find completing weekly practice charts work
                better. It is important for individuals to figure out what
                method works best for them. Students who practice daily
                consistently outperform those who do not, regardless of talent
                or age.
              </p>
              <h4>Posture</h4>
              <p>
                Students should maintain good posture while playing. Slouching,
                slumping or resting all one's weight on one foot, etc. lead to
                poor sound.
              </p>
              <h4>Viola Position</h4>
              <p>
                It is important to avoid what teachers infamously refer to as
                the pizza wrist. The wrist and palm should not be touching the
                viola while one is playing.
              </p>
              <h4>Bow Hold</h4>
              <p>
                The bow should not be gripped in a fist. There are several
                different bow holds. The student and their parent should consult
                with the teacher to find out which one the teacher thinks is
                most appropriate. The student should check their bow hold
                regularly during their practicing session.
              </p>
              <h4>Maintenance</h4>
              <p>
                To get the best your instrument has to offer, you should make
                sure to follow the proper care instructions. Remember, there is
                both yearly and daily maintenance, and both are equally
                important.

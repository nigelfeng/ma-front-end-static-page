                This is an electronic device that produces a steady stream of
                clicks. It’s a tool designed to help the student play at a
                steady tempo in the proper rhythm.

              <p>
                A music stand is required for proper posture. If the music is
                not placed at approximately eye level, this will have a negative
                impact on the student's posture. Improper posture has a negative
                impact on the student's sound and health over time.
              </p>
              <h4>Notebook</h4>
              <p>
                A notebook is great tool for success. A notebook lets the
                student (or their teacher) take notes about new terms, what
                music they should be practicing, what goals the student has,
                etc.
              </p>
              <h4>Pencils</h4>
              <p>
                Pencils are useful to write in both the student’s notebook and
                also in their sheet music. Sometimes it is useful for the
                student to make notes in their music regarding fingerings or
                dynamics. It’s good to make these notes in pencil rather than
                pen in case they need to be changed later.

              <p>
                This is a soft cloth used for wiping off rosin dust. When rosin
                dust builds up on the violin, it dampens the sound and the
                instrument will not sound as good. Excess rosin dust can also
                cause the violin to become sticky to the touch. This will
                eventually will damage the varnish. While a yearly professional
                cleaning is recommended, this will help maintain your instrument
                in the meantime.

              <p>
                Rosin needs to be applied to the bow hair at the beginning of
                each playing session. There are two basic types of rosin: light
                (or amber) rosin and dark rosin. If you live in a humid area,
                you will want to use light rosin. If you live in a dry or arid
                climate, you should choose dark rosin. If the area you live in
                experiences a large change in humidity during the year (such as
                the midwest) and you only want to purchase one rosin, you should
                choose the light rosin.

                This is a tool used to aid in both posture and proper violin
                hold. While they are sometimes unnecessary for younger players,
                most older students need them. They come in many styles, from a
                simple foam pad to a framework with solid padding, and are sized
                to your instrument.

                This is an electronic device that helps students make sure their
                violin is in tune before they start practicing. If the violin is
                not in tune, the student can be playing perfectly but will still
                not produce the correct notes.

            <div>
              <h4>Pegs</h4>
              <p>
                Pegs are the four black knobs at the top of the violin. They are
                used for making large tuning adjustments.
              </p>
              <h4>Fingerboard</h4>
              <p>
                The fingerboard is the long black piece underneath the strings.
                To get the best quality sound when playing, the bow must be kept
                off of this part of the violin.
              </p>
              <h4>Strings</h4>
              <p>
                The violin has four strings. Listed in descending order, they
                are: E, A, D, G. The E string is the thinnest and
                highest-sounding of the strings, and the G is the thickest and
                lowest-sounding.

              <h4>F-holes</h4>
              <p>
                The F-holes are the two holes on the front of the violin. They
                help the violin project its sound, so it is important not to
                cover them when playing and to not let anything ever fall in
                them.
              </p>
              <h4>Chin Rest</h4>
              <p>
                This is an oval piece of wood or plastic, usually black in
                color, located next to the tailpiece. This is where the player's
                chin/jaw rests. If the instrument is missing this piece, or if
                it slips off, you should take your violin to be repaired, as it
                is impossible to hold the instrument properly without it.
              </p>
              <h4>Tailpiece</h4>
              <p>
                The tailpiece is located on the bottom front of the violin, just
                underneath the bridge. All four strings attach to it.
              </p>
              <h4>Fine Tuners</h4>
              <p>
                The fine tuners are the little screws located on the tailpiece.
                They are used for making minor tuning adjustments. As there is
                no risk of breaking a string when tuning with fine tuners, it is
                perfectly fine for students with no tuning experience to tune
                with these.
              </p>
              <h4>Sound Post</h4>
              <p>
                The soundpost is a small wooden rod located on the inside of the
                violin. You can usually see it by looking through the f-holes.
                It helps to amplify the sound of the violin.

              <h3>About Your Bow</h3>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4>Stick</h4>
              <p>
                The stick of the bow is the long wooden part of your instrument.
                It is important to make sure that it is never too tight. The
                stick should always have a 'recurve', or should always curve
                under slightly. If the stick is straight or is bowed over, it is
                too tight and will eventually warp.
              </p>
              <h4>Hair</h4>
              <p>
                The hair of the bow, aptly named because it is usually made out
                of horsehair, is found opposite the stick. The hair must be
                rosined every time the instrument is taken out and played,
                otherwise it will be very difficult to make any sound on the
                violin.
              </p>
              <h4>Frog</h4>
              <p>
                The frog is the chunky part at the end of the bow, which is
                where the student should be holding the bow.
              </p>
              <h4>Screw</h4>
              <p>
                The screw is located at the end of the bow, just after the frog.
                Turning the screw to the right tightens the bow and turning it
                to the left loosens it.
              </p>

              <h3>Scheduling and Measuring Practice</h3>
            </div>
            <div>
              <p>
                Practicing the correct amount is very important. Practicing too
                little will impede the student's progress, while practicing too
                much can lead to fatigue, frustration, and even injury. I often
                tell my students to treat playing the violin like a
                weightlifting. If you want to get good at it, you have to do it
                every day, but you need to start out small and work your way up
                so that your muscles have a chance to build.
              </p>
              <p>
                A good guideline for practicing is to go by how long your lesson
                is. If you have a 30-minute lesson, you should practice
                approximately 30 minutes per day. Some students have difficulty
                focusing for that long, especially younger students. In that
                situation, I take a different approach and have students
                practice each task/assignment five times. That way, you go over
                your scales five times, your etude five times and your solo five
                times. This method ensures that you get to everything your
                teacher assigned and it gives the student clear stopping points
                if they need to take a break.

              </ul>

              <ul class="arrow">
                <li>
                  Sudden and extreme changes in temperature are bad for your
                  instrument. Although your case helps slow down these changes,
                  it is still a good idea to avoid exposing your instrument to
                  places that are excessively hot, cold, humid, or dry. Extreme
                  temperature changes put your instrument at risk for cracking,
                  separated seams, broken joints, and snapped strings.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Cold – You can take your instrument out into a snowstorm as
                  long as it is in a properly insulated case. It is best to
                  avoid doing so, however, unless absolutely necessary.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Damp – Your instrument should never be exposed to excess
                  humidity. Too much moisture will cause the wood to warp and
                  the glue to break down. While a well-insulated case should
                  protect the instrument, consider covering the case in a
                  garbage bag if going out in especially heavy snow or rain.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Heat – Too much heat can cause severe damage to the joints and
                  seams of your violin. It can also melt the glue holding your
                  instrument together. Never store your instrument in direct
                  sunlight or in the car.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Dry – Wood needs some moisture to keep its shape, otherwise it
                  can become brittle and crack. If the area you are in is
                  extremely dry, you should invest in an instrument humidifier
                  to protect your violin.
                </li>

                  Earthquake/tornado – If you live in an area prone to
                  earthquakes or tornadoes, never store your instrument near a
                  piece of furniture that might fall (ex: bookcases). A heavy
                  object falling on your violin, even while it is in the case,
                  can cause severe damage to your instrument.

              <ul class="arrow">
                <li>
                  Due to the fact that it is easy to break a string accidentally
                  when tuning with the pegs, it is recommended that the
                  student/parent not use them without first receiving specific
                  instruction from their teacher.
                </li>
                <li>
                  To get the best sound from the violin, it is recommended that
                  all the strings be changed at least once per year. Picking a
                  memorable date for your annual strings change (birthday,
                  Christmas, Independence Day, etc) is recommended so that you
                  don't forget when you last changed your strings.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If your soundpost ever falls, you should loosen all the
                  strings immediately and take it to get repaired. Never play on
                  a violin without a soundpost, as this can cause irreparable
                  damage to the instrument.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It is important to never touch the bow hair, as the oils on
                  our skin will make the hair dirty. When the bow hair is dirty,
                  it will not make as much sound, no matter how much rosin is
                  applied. Never leave your violin alone in the car. Not only
                  can it get stolen, the change in temperature in an unattended
                  car can cause irreparable damage to your instrument. Too much
                  heat can cause the varnish to bubble and glue to unstick,
                  while too much cold can cause the instrument to crack.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Always keep your violin in the case when it is not in use.
                  Never leave it on a chair, or worse, the floor.

              <h3>Forming Good Habits, Not Bad Habits</h3>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4>Practicing</h4>
              <p>
                It is important to make practicing a habit that happens every
                day. Some people find that a practice chart helps them get their
                practicing done while others work it into their daily routine.
                Students who practice daily consistently outperform those who do
                not, regardless of talent or age.
              </p>
              <h4>Posture</h4>
              <p>
                Students should be standing/sitting straight while playing.
                Slouching, slumping and resting all one's weight on one foot can
                lead to poor sound.
              </p>
              <h4>Violin Position</h4>
              <p>
                When holding the violin, the wrist/palm should not be touching
                the instrument (aka, the infamous 'pizza wrist').
              </p>
              <h4>Bow Hold</h4>
              <p>
                While teachers recommend different bow holds, one constant is
                that the bow should not be gripped in a fist. If you are unsure
                about the proper bow hold, ask your teacher for help.
              </p>
              <h4>Maintenance</h4>
              <p>
                Always follow the care instructions for your instrument, to
                ensure it is in proper working order. This will help you get the
                best out of your instrument.

              <h3 class="umb-text--normal">The Components</h3>
              <p>
                The following are major components of written music that
                students must become familiar with in order to become
                comfortable with singing from sheet music:
              </p>
              <ul class="arrow">
                <li>
                  <strong>The Notes:</strong> Every note written on sheet music
                  or staff paper corresponds to a key sung with the voice. The
                  notes on the music will tell you which notes to sing.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>The Rhythms:</strong> Each note will be a certain
                  shape and color. These differences in shape and color dictate
                  how long each note should be held for.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>The Time Signatures:</strong> The time signature tells
                  you how many beats are in each measure. This will give you the
                  “feel” for how a piece is to be played.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>The Dynamics: </strong>Communicates volume and
                  intensity of the music being sung.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>The Tempo:</strong> How fast or slow the music moves
                  in time.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>The Interpretation:</strong> A combination of a
                  composer’s written intentions for performance and the
                  vocalist’s technique. Character is often associated with
                  interpretation.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>THE LANGUAGE:</strong>If a piece of music is in a
                  foreign language, teachers will often assist students in the
                  pronunciation of the performance. See optional IPA book of
                  choice below.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3 class="umb-text--normal">Tools for Success</h3>
              <h4>Pencils</h4>
              <p>
                Pencils are necessary in taking notes to compose notes and
                helpful reminders for best practices. Your teacher is a trained
                singer with the insight and skill to instruct. Taking notes
                increases the likelihood of a student remembering important
                technical skills. Audio recording devices are also often helpful
                to record critical instructions. Ask your instructor about this
                practice.

                >
              </h4>
              <p>
                Whether a beginner or a professional, no vocalist is complete
                without sheet music. This is the literature from which the
                singer will learn to read and perform. The student’s teacher
                will have good judgement as to which pieces are best for study
                based on age, range, character, style, time period and content.
                Selecting age and character-appropriate music is the key to
                growth, vocal health and technique. Singing music that is not
                appropriate for one’s own voice can lead to vocal issues such as
                hoarseness and nodules. See vocal health below.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is imperative that vocalists read music because most of a
                composer’s intentions are expressed not only through melody and
                rhythm but also through dynamics, language, and tempo markings.
                A well-rounded singer will interpret multiple aspects of sheet
                music at the same time. Singers should plan to sing from all
                categories of music including, but not limited to Broadway,
                foreign languages, jazz, opera, art songs, pop and standards.

                Warming Up: Just as an athlete trains for a marathon, a singer
                will train for a vocal production. Technical skills that build
                the instrument (your voice) and the skill (your brain) are
                advised. Warm-ups are meant to gently stretch the vocal folds
                and diaphragm mechanisms.

                Practicing with the correct posture will lead not only to
                correct acquisition of skills but a healthy routine as well.
                Singing with incorrect posture can lead to fatigue and possibly
                worse, injury!
              </p>
              <h3 class="umb-text--normal">Practice Time</h3>
              <p>
                Make sure the following are met each time before you begin
                singing:
              </p>
              <ul class="arrow">
                <li>
                  Lean slightly forward with one foot spaced in front of the
                  other so you have balance, intention and focus.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Your head should be kept straight by using the “Puppet
                  Method.” To do this, gently lift a hair in the middle-top of
                  your head as if you were on a puppet string. This will align
                  your posture instantly.
                </li>
                <li>The jaw and tongue remain relaxed and gently loose.</li>
                <li>Keep knees loose and relaxed.</li>
                <li>
                  Shoulders should be down and relaxed at all times. Avoid
                  raising shoulders at inhalation (see diagram of breathing
                  above).
                </li>
                <li>Arms and hands should remain loose and relaxed.</li>
              </ul>
              <h3 class="umb-text--normal">Practice Log</h3>
              <p>
                A practice log is essentially a journal that helps you to keep
                track of what, when and for how long you practiced. This is not
                only helpful to the teacher who will help keep track of your
                progress, but it will also help you develop a sense of routine
                and to keep track of what you may need any extra help with. Your
                instructor will direct you to the number of minutes advised for
                practice each week.

                So, you’ve got your new instrument, but now what? You need
                clear, specific instructions on how to start playing. How do you
                hold your instrument? When does it need cleaning or a tune-up?
                Where and how often should you practice? No matter if the
                instruments are woodwinds, brass, guitars, percussion, or piano,
                we can help.<br /><br />Our resource guides are written by
                lesson instructors or professional musicians, and are aimed at
                the brand-new beginner player. With easy-to-follow descriptions,
                videos, and pictures, they help make the introduction to your
                instrument easy, from mouth and hand placement to reading sheet
                music. Select your instrument below to get started with a more
                in-depth look at its anatomy, the tools and accessories required
                for successful play, methods for cleaning and maintenance, and
                tips for practice discipline and posture.<br /><br />Are you a
                few weeks into your practice and still hitting some speed bumps?
                We’ve got suggestions and solutions. At the Music &amp; Arts’
                Lesson Studio we have more than 65 years of instrument
                experience in rentals, sales, lessons, and repairs. All of our
                lesson instructors trained at the university level and have vast
                experience with their chosen instrument.

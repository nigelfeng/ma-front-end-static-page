                Because prices, rental terms, product descriptions and

                not warrant the accuracy or completeness of the information
                provided on the Site. Also, Music &amp; Arts Center may make
                changes to the information contained herein, including to the
                products, prices and rental terms described in the site, at any
                time, without prior notice to you (including after you have
                submitted your order). Information at this Site is periodically
                updated, but it may not be current or complete at the moment you
                visit this Site and may contain errors or inaccuracies. In no
                event shall Music &amp; Arts Center or its service or product
                providers be liable to you in any manner whatsoever for any
                decision made by you, or for any act or failure to act by you,
                in reliance upon information provided at this Site. If a product
                you purchase or rent does not match the description on the Site,
                as your sole and exclusive remedy you may return the product,
                unused, to Music &amp; Arts Center and receive a refund of your
                purchase price and any rental fees paid.

                Items in your shopping cart will reflect the most recent price
                displayed on the item's product detail page. Prices are
                frequently updated to adjust for different sales, limited
                pricing, and other discounting. Therefore, prices on the product
                detail page and in your cart may change after such updates to
                reflect the current prices. Placing items in your cart does not
                reserve the current prices shown at that time, and prices are
                reserved only by placing an order. From time to time, despite
                our efforts, a small number of the items in print collateral may
                be mispriced. Please note that such errors or inaccuracies may
                be related to product descriptions, pricing and availability. In
                the event of a pricing error, Music &amp; Arts Center will take
                one of the following options: (1) If an item's correct price is
                lower than our stated price, we will charge the lower amount and
                ship you the item; or (2) if an item's correct price is higher
                than our stated price, we will, at our discretion, either
                contact you for instructions before shipping or cancel your
                order and notify you of such cancellation. We apologize for any
                inconvenience. If you are not satisfied with your purchase due
                to any errors or inaccuracies, you may return it in accordance
                with our
                <a href="/cms/faq/returns-exchanges/">return procedure</a>.

                List Price is the suggested retail selling price of a product
                provided to us by manufacturers. We may commonly sell products
                at prices lower than List Price, and, for any given product, no
                sales may have occurred at List Price. List Price is a benchmark
                to compare our discounts from List Price to pricing offered by
                other retailers. Whether other retailers sell at List Price will
                vary by product, geographic location, type of store, and over
                time. Although we periodically update the List Prices in our
                direct mail offerings and on our website as we receive them, in
                some cases manufacturers may change a suggested retail price
                without notice to us. Please contact the manufacturer of a
                specific product for the most up-to-date List Price information.
                List Prices quoted for house or private label brands are
                developed internally in consideration of comparable name brand
                products. We may commonly sell such products at prices lower
                than List Price and, for any given product, no sales may have
                occurred at List Price. Although our limited time events are
                intended to be limited time events, our low prices offered
                during these events may continue in effect after the event.

                If any provision of these Terms of Use is held by a court of
                competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable for any reason, the
                remaining provisions hereof shall be unaffected and remain in
                full force and effect. These Terms of Use shall for all purposes
                be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of
                the State of Maryland as those laws are applied to contracts
                entered into and to be performed entirely in Maryland, without
                regard to conflicts of law provisions. Any suit or proceeding
                arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use shall be
                commenced exclusively in state or federal court in Frederick
                County, Maryland, and you irrevocably submit to the exclusive
                jurisdiction and venue of such courts.

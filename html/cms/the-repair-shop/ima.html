                Most people choose to include
                <strong>Liability Damage Waiver (LDW)</strong> with their
                instrument rental. LDW covers maintenance, repairs, and loss due
                to theft or fire while you are renting the instrument. Best of
                all, it can be cancelled at any time. Contact your

                To protect your instrument purchase, we also offer another
                coverage plan,
                <strong>Instrument Maintenance Agreement (IMA)</strong>. An IMA
                is a cost-effective way to go beyond home owner's insurance
                policies and manufacturer's warranties. It includes regular
                maintenance check-ups, part replacements, and cleaning.

                  Repairs are not covered by most home- owner’s insurance
                  policies without a special rider and/or deductible.
                  Manufacturer’s warranties only cover defects, not adjustments
                  due to normal use.

                  The cost of one year’s coverage = one average visit to the
                  repair shop, so the coverage pays for itself even if the
                  instrument only comes in once a year for adjustment.

                Musical instruments qualifying for immediate enrollment without
                pre-evaluation are all Music &amp; Arts band and orchestra
                instruments purchased from one of our stores, if you purchase
                the IMA agreement at time of instrument purchase. Other new and
                used instruments purchased at Music &amp; Arts may be enrolled
                based on condition and value at Music &amp; Arts’ sole
                discretion. Music &amp; Arts may require repair as a
                prerequisite to enrollment. Music &amp; Arts will provide a cost
                estimate for the repair if Music &amp; Arts determines repair is
                necessary to qualify for enrollment. Payment for repair and/or
                enrollment is due at time of signing. Instruments purchased from
                a non-Music &amp; Arts vendor may be enrolled at Music &amp;
                Arts’ discretion after the instrument passes inspection and any
                necessary repairs are completed and paid for in full.
